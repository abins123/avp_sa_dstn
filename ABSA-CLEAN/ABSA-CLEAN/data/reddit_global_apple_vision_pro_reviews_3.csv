Apple Reportedly Suspends Work on Vision Pro 2,,2213,1dittcu,apple,https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/apple-suspends-work-on-vision-pro-2/,681,1718725446.0
"After 12 hours inside, it's clear Apple mis-marketed the Vision Pro","I received my Vision Pro Friday morning, and have spent roughly 12-15 hours inside already. I have a couple thoughts I'd like to share, if anybody is interested.

This is without a doubt, the most incredible piece of consumer technology ever shipped. Unfortunately, I believe there was a breakdown internally at Apple between the R&D department and the marketing department in releasing this product.

Apple has focused on a variety of ""gimmicky"" features in marketing and demo'ing the AVP; dinosaurs, spatial video, EyeSight, FaceTime w/ personas, etc. This was a bit of an ""own goal"" on Apple's part, that has lead to a smattering of hit piece reviews, particularly Nilay Patels. His review, WILL NOT AGE WELL. I promise you all that.

These reviews are focusing on the gimmicky features Apple pushed towards the public to pique their interest. And due to this mis-marketing, muckraker reporters like Nilay Patel have called out Apple's mistake by focusing their reviews on the gimmicks, rather than the strength of the platform, which is truly groundbreaking. For instance, personas are irrelevant to this system. It's fun, it solves a small FaceTime issue. It should not have been a material part of Nilay's review, and instead he (and many others) decry Apple for putting out a weird uncanny valley beta avatar. This is akin to reviewing the first iterations of the Ford Model T, and saying ""I really can't believe you have to get out of the car and start it with a hand crank"". Then stating people shouldn't buy the car, and should stick with the horse and buggy, because it's not a convenient apparatus to start.

People are failing to understand that this is not a VR/AR headset that does X, Y, and Z. Apple developed a spatial computing platform (as properly marketed by Apple), which allows you to do whatever you'd like to do, and whatever developers can dream up. The Vision Pro, is simply the apparatus to see it through. The base of the spatial computing system and Vision OS 1.0 is truly remarkable and something I never thought I would see in my lifetime. Is it slightly buggy... actually NO! It's fairly rock solid, more so than I thought, and much more than appears in the vid captures from the device in reviews. These screencaptures do not do the OS justice, as it shows the ""foveated rendering"" which you cannot see with your eyes while using the device.

For instance last night, I was lying in bed, in a VR environment, looking at the stars, in crystal clear clarity, with a small window open talking to a friend via Messages, and just beyond that, mounted in the sky, was a 100 foot wide screen which had The Social Network running in simply the clearest quality I have ever seen outside of 15/70 IMAX.

This is a hard concept to market because it's so flexible. It relies on the creativity of the user in order to truly shine, just like a laptop. Some people will do amazing things with Mac OS, and some people will just answer emails and watch YouTube. This is a computing PLATFORM, not a DEVICE or a TOY.

In so many of these reviews, they simply pull up a safari window and watch YouTube and say ""that's cool, but really what else can we do?"" Then they show the poor personas and say, well Apple really missed the mark here. It's hard to describe just how much a window is like a piece of glass in Vision OS, that is SO ANCHORED DOWN in 3D space. It's up to the user to decide how to use this in a fun and productive way, and 99% of tech reviews, aren't that creative! I won’t even discuss the eye tracking technology, because it just works. It’s indescribably accurate. 

One more tidbit; from the design of the hardware, it is clear to me that the Apple Design team was aiming for a ""space travel"" / “moonshot” theme. The Vision Pro case is a dyneema-like covered padded box, similar to the boxes NASA uses with padding and white ripstop material on their space missions and in their spacesuits. The Vision Pro itself has a very ""Stormtrooper"" look. Even the orange release tabs for the headbands all scream ""space travel"", ""state of the art aviation"", and ""government special projects"" to me. I believe this is all because the intent of the product from the Design Dept. is to prepare you for traveling to another world, like the exploration of space, the final frontier. This is more akin to a Virgin Galatic flight than iPad. This is the final frontier of computing, and we will never return to physical screens again in a real way again.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

PS, this article is to illustrate how Apple's mis-marketing of the device lead to milquetoast reviews and a lot of public backlash / hate. It is my belief that these reviewers judged the product against Apple's marketing expectations (which is their right) vs. what was shipped in the box.

&#x200B;

I'm happy to answer any questions anyone might dream up.

Go buy a Vision Pro and experience a pull forward in consumer tech that is perhaps 5-10 years beyond our MacBooks and iPhones.",917,1ajki9t,VisionPro,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1ajki9t/after_12_hours_inside_its_clear_apple_mismarketed/,588,1707150343.0
Average person's review of the Vision Pro,"Here's my review of the Vision Pro (and why I'll be returning it) from a pretty average person's perspective. I want to add the caveat at the outset that this thing is totally magical. I loved the demo at the store and bought one on the spot. However, one of the reviews was right: it's magical until it's not anymore. As a note, I'm a super average user: mostly research and writing (legal field) with some video. This device has HUGE promise, but it'll take some time to iron things out. I'm going to try to focus on practical elements because I so wanted this thing to replace my computer. Also, I recognize that this is just day two and this device will make huge strides. However, those strides will come in spurts over the next two to three years, and won't be available any time soon.

Quick rundown of my notes:

* Loved the out of box functionality and feel. Everything is incredibly well thought-out (up to a point).
* Super cool environments.
* App functionality is limited.
* Not as many use cases. The internet is still designed for traditional computers (but this will likely change over time!).
* Heavy. So heavy.
* Passthrough complaints are overstated. I thought it was good!
* Good luck working at a desk and drinking coffee/tea with this thing on.

So I started using this thing yesterday after I picked it up, and the unboxing was fantastic as always. Eye tracking is super smooth, and it recreated the feeling of trying something truly ""futuristic"" for the first time. However, as I began to use it more, it's begun feeling more like a new screen that's just heavy and impedes interacting with my dog and fiancée. I do legal research and a lot of writing for a living, so I partially knew this may not work for me. I started by pairing it to my Mac for the screen sharing (Mac Virtual Display) and was immediately met by the seemingly standard Apple technical decisions: you can't... pair your AirPods with the Mac? The virtual display won't play audio from the Mac at all in fact? It's one of those dumb little quirks that will get ironed out, I'm sure, but when I anticipate so many will be using the virtual display, it's not great. I do like that I can blow up my screen to be huge, but also only being able to only have one instance of your Mac at a time rather than multiple windows is really disappointing too. I had hoped I'd be able to run two instances side-by-side to give me unlimited monitor space, but that's likely for future generations. However, my workaround has been to have a Safari instance open alongside the virtual display, as well as Apple Music. It still feels kind of bad that I can't just natively use YouTube in my Mac's instance, but that can be sort of remedied by the Safari workaround for now (didn't bother to pay for Juno).

Also, minor frustration that can easily be worked out (and likely will be soon): I can't pair my MX Master mouse? Passthrough with my keyboard works perfectly, but there's no mouse functionality and the Vision Pro says my mouse isn't supported. That kind of sucked for navigating things easily outside of virtual display.

The actual functionality of VisionOS is pretty much perfect. I love its feel, and it's super responsive. I'm also certain that it'll improve immensely over time, adding cool new features we didn't know we wanted/needed. It will also hopefully influence the way we use the internet—the current internet architecture is for phones, but spatial computing is so cool. But for now, opening up Reddit on this thing is just like being on my laptop or phone. I guess one minor concern is that this is a walled garden machine with a lot of DRM capabilities, and part of me laments that the open-ended nature of the laptop might go away if this thing takes off.

For actual work, it's cool. I like that I can be sitting at Mt. Hood and writing, and that you can adjust your environment's wraparound so you can still see things like your door. However, it's still a little strange to me to feel, in a way, blinded and deafened (if I'm wearing my AirPods). Not as much of an issue because you can always use the admittedly very good speakers built into the headset and there's the passthrough functionality, but it's still a little unsettling to someone who has a dog. I can't really see him and I guess I didn't expect to but it's weird to not interact with him as much as I would if I was sitting at a computer. I get why some reviewers have said it feels a little more lonely in here. If I was single and didn't have a pet, this would probably be more ""useful"" if that makes sense. I've been able to work well on this device, but it all more or less happens within an instance of my Mac, which makes this feel a little like an extra step. A lot of people might end up feeling like this is an iPad analogue rather than a regular computer: it's very much ALMOST there, but may just end up becoming a more niche device that people can't fully use for work but like to use for some work purposes.

As I've been working, the novelty has been fading more, which is good! I think the novelty is a huge selling point, which I certainly appreciate. However, at the end of the day, it's an eye computer. I like that I can watch sports on a big screen, but I also like to watch sports socially, so this is a little weird. However, if they end up adding functionality where I can get a seat at a stadium for a soccer or football game and feel like I'm there, that would be so awesome. I would use this thing almost solely for that if I could, but again, it makes more sense for people who are alone—I'm a social sports watcher and not having someone else be able to see what I'm seeing and react to that with me would leave me feeling like something is missing. For TV/movies, that's certainly the number one use case, but again, because it's strapped to your eyes, it's a necessarily solo experience. I'm sure some will roll their eyes and say ""what did you expect? It's an AR/VR headset."" And they'd be correct, but that also limits some of its use cases to being highly individualized necessarily. The magic of this thing is definitely in immersive experiences, and they're something I'm excited for, but only in small doses. I don't really want to ""live"" in this thing—I want to use it every so often for a movie when my fiancée is watching TV or I'm lounging around with some downtime and I'm not socializing. It's a really cool unplugging type of device, but one for limited time quantities.

This is also due to the weight. I'm sure my neck muscles would get stronger over time, but I can't let this thing sit on my head for more than 45 minutes. I wrote this review while in the Vision Pro, and already I'm feeling the neck strain. I'm wearing the dual loop strap, and it's fantastic, but even that can't save me from the weight fatigue. Using this thing on a long-haul flight (as I had originally intended) might be okay give the back and head rests, but absent that, it's a little tough.

I don't care about the personas stuff but the debate is also pointless to me: it's an eye computer that's approximating your entire face. It'll improve in time, but even the way they look now is mostly fine. That said, I would not show up to a Zoom call for work with a persona in its current state (though I also wouldn't show up using a persona probably ever for what it's worth). 

Another issue for future generations to work out: I can't see my iPhone. I would love if the Vision Pro could just display your iPhone's screen within the Vision Pro's screen. For dealing with annoying Duo notifications or checking emails quickly, this is a must-have for me, which mars the experience a little more.

Finally, I can't drink tea with this on. I'm sure that's funny but every time I lift my mug up to my face, it clinks against the visor and I have to be very careful about how I angle it to get a sip. I don't know if this can even really be solved for (maybe a slimmer facial profile?) and I know this is very silly, but it just leaves me asking myself ""why not just use a regular computer?""

In sum, this is a really amazing device that blew my mind when I first used it. However, beyond the novelty, it's left me feeling like I'm using a computer with extra steps. I will be returning it, but this thing has SO much promise. I went in wanting to love it as much as the demo, but it still just can't compete with my regular computer. In a few generations, it may be very competitive with that, but for now, it's worth skipping. Most people are average like me and won't have much use for it beyond cool movies and showing it to your partner who then asks ""why is there $3500 missing from our bank account?""",101,1ahvgth,VisionPro,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1ahvgth/average_persons_review_of_the_vision_pro/,151,1706964834.0

Over 60 Days with Apple Vision Pro - Reflections and Experience - No more hate,"I've been using headsets for over 7 years now. I've practically tried out every Virtual Reality headset out there (except for some professional ones): HDK OSVR 1.4, PIMAX 4K, PIMAX 8k, PIMAX 8KX, PIMAX 5K Super, PIMAX Crystal, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Vive Pro, Vive Cosmos, Vive Pro 2, Vive XR Elite, Valve Index, Rift S, Quest 1, Quest 2, Quest Pro, Magic Leap, nReal, DPVR E4, and currently Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro.

I don't think I could even count the hundreds of hours I've spent using all this technology. I'm involved in XR outreach, and well, I've had quite a privileged position in all of this. Additionally, many of you might know me as a member of Infinity One and as one of the creators of Air Cover.

For me, the Apple Vision Pro is the most impressive Extended Reality headset I've ever tested, both in terms of technology and user experience. It hasn't revolutionized anything, but it has stirred up the market with a different vision than we've had in recent years.

The Apple Vision Pro has the best screens I've seen, the best sound, the best passthrough, the best gesture recognition, and the best interface I've encountered in a device of this kind. It's intuitive, easy to handle, although there are times when I'd like to smash it against the ground when the eye tracking doesn't work as it should. Then I remember its cost, and that thought slips away.

When Tim presented it, I saw it clearly: they provide the Hardware, and it's the ""obligation"" of developers to create content to make this gadget usable. And I think this is the main problem many people are having: usability.

Apple marketed it as a space computing system where you can work with spatial multitasking windows and connect it to our Macs (or PC with moonlight, Immersed, etc), as well as a device to view flat and immersive multimedia content. Unfortunately, the media hype surrounding it led many people to be interested in it, especially because they were goofing around in their TikTok and YouTube videos.

[Air Cover + Nylon Strap + Monster Mod BOBOVR 😂](https://preview.redd.it/4tv8v1s0hzzc1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ee16c2a43d84a847ea2a925642ae340192b1fe8)

Luckily, I'm a restless person and I give a lot of usability to the Apple Vision Pro, not only to start designing contraptions to improve ergonomics like this one I'm showing you with a sliding system to place the battery on the back using part of a BOBOVR Strap from the Quest 2 (It was just an experiment, and I had to withdraw it because of the excessive weight it entailed using it like that.), but also for what I'm about to tell you:

* It allows me to use my virtual PC screen (moonlight) to work with it.
* I have multitasking systems with Telegram, Discord, Mail while the main focus is on the Moonlight screen.
* It allows me to connect to SteamVR (PC) via ALVR. Yesterday, I spent about 4 hours in VRChat with the Apple Vision Pro and without controllers (using hand tracking to move).
* It allows me to watch multimedia content alone or with company.
* It allows me to meet with part of the Apple Vision Pro community with Spatial Persona and chat with them.
* It allows me to show my designs to friends or family via Facetime.
* It allows me to browse these forums and stay up-to-date on news of all kinds.
* It allows me to control all 3D printers with their iPad applications.
* It allows me to play Arcade games by connecting the PS5 controller.
* It allows me to watch spatial videos of my son or my pets (I have an iPhone 15 Pro).
* It allows me to write scripts (I have a foldable Bluetooth keyboard) with a touchpad, and by activating Assistive Touch, I can use it as a mouse.

In short, it allows me to use it for everything I want and more. Still, the product is not perfect:

* The weight distribution is terrible. Apple needs to work a lot on this. We designed the Air Cover and the Nylon Strap to achieve the most bearable balance possible.
* It doesn't have virtual controllers, which would have been great for immersive gaming (although I have a feeling Apple doesn't want this type of content).
* We lack more specific content for a particular use, taking advantage of the benefits of Mixed Reality or Spatial Computing. The famous ""killer app"".
* Its price is a significant barrier for consumers, but not for developers or businesses that truly want to harness the potential of this device. The average person will only be able to buy it if they have that money and will truly make use of it.

We are at the birth of this device, a product that due to its high price and the amount of integrated technology is more than evident that it is a development product, so that all developers can use it and create unique experiences. Still, it's a product that can reach consumers, for people who can really afford it and want to use it, but without a doubt, it's a great product.

I understand the frustration of many people who have spent more than $3500 and end up returning it or leaving it in a drawer because they don't know how to use it, but personally, I am very happy with the purchase and extremely proud to own Apple Vision Pro.

What must be clear is that if you're one of those people who enjoys using Apple Vision Pro, keep doing so. Don't let yourself feel down if you go to any place and are bombarded with negative information. Generally, dissatisfied people complain, while those who enjoy something don't go to a forum to talk about it 😉

Just tried the Apple Vision Pro today. Not impressed ,"Got an AVP demo at the Apple store today… and all I can think is thank God I saved my money. 

I’ll start with the bad

Hand tracking has serious latency issues, q3 actually has equivalent or better hand tracking imo. I had quite a few missed taps and moving my hands around with something virtual tracking them showed that there’s at least 60-100ms of latency for hand tracking. 

Eye tracking either has minor latency issues or the responsiveness of highlighting is messed up. Psvr2 has quicker and more accurate eye tracking imo. 

The fov is god awful. I think my original vive had better fov, it can’t be more than 70-80 degrees based on what I experienced. You get used to it pretty quickly but there was major shock having played my q3 immediately before. Undoubtedly they play it safe with the closeness of the headset for demos, and this would improve from getting the lenses closer, but this was my experience and the lenses are very small compared to others on the market now. (Had to edit this)

The brightness is extremely lacking, pass through feels like you’re wearing sunglasses. 

We’re still far away from “wow I can’t tell I’m wearing a headset” level pass through. They managed to eliminate the wavy outlines that occur in quest pass through when you hold your hand or phone up, but whatever they did to fix this made depth perception difficult. 

3D videos taken on the avp look like they’re recorded in 720p, although the vids taken from iPhone were actually quite impressive. 

The occlusion with your hands being visible in environments is the best I’ve seen, but it’s still far from perfect. Tons of edges peeking through. 

It is wildly uncomfortable, major pressure on my forehead and considering maybe 100,000 people bought one at most, there’s not going to be any 3rd party facial interfaces. 

Now for some good, I’ll give credit where credit is due. 
Resolution is stunning, best I’ve seen, but that’s also with a small field of view so…. PPD is artificially increased by that. 

8k high framerate vr videos look AMAZING, this is the one thing i say they’ve done absolutely incredibly. Movies look good too and you can really see the detail. 

Rendered things such as environments and the Dino demo look STUNNING like… as good or better than pc graphics. 

The windows do stay put and the shadows are cool. 


TLDR; it’s about 50% better than the quest 3 in terms of the overall experience, but 700% more expensive, and without controllers or games, they really shit themselves on this one. Tons of potential, most of it missed. I would not want to use this for anything productive, it’s majorly uncomfortable, and productivity is the only use case I could possibly see with this device. I’d maybe pay $300 for this, not 3500. For the price of a Varjo headset, I expect to be blown away at everything, but it’s just a good bit better than other hmds at certain things, and drastically lacking in other departments.

One month review of Vision Pro as a hardcore PCVR user,"Okay I’ve been using my Vision Pro for a month and here is what I though about this product overall.


Comfort: this is an issue mentioned by many tech reviewers and non hardcore VR users, “it’s heavy blah blah blah”
This thing is not lightweight compared to Xreal Pro 2 but for us, VR hardcore users who haven been trained by something like Pimax Crystal, Varjo XR4( both are 2 pounds/1kg+ hmds), VP is nothing in fact I can now use it for several hrs seated with solo knit band for web browsing & movie viewing. If you get the right facial gasket, the pressure points can be adjusted to the forehead rather than the cheekbones, which is quire comfortable.


FOV: 21W is doing the magic for me to get close to Quest 3/Pro horizontal FOV and vertical is also not that bad anymore, again this device is not very sensitive to FOV as a mixed reality headset.


Input method: eye tracking+hand gestures is not yet accurate enough to be the only input method, the more I use it, the more I feel like this is just a PSVR2 level eye tracking, for simple game menu it’s fine but for productivity and even just web browsing, a lot times I can’t choose the right tab/words I want even I’m pretty sure I’m staring at what I want to select, Apple, plz improve this with your next gen VP with best eye tracking module you can buy, this PSVR2 level accuracy is a joke for general computing, in fact I feel Quest 3 is easier to use with hand tracking despite many ppl don’t like its UX/UI.


Build quality: 10/10, better than Varjo XR4, those Chinese really know how to make good consumer electronics nowadays. But the solo knit band is certainly not worth $100 each…I was considering getting 2nd one for top strap mod but I think I’m good for now.

Productivity:
No one mentioned but you can still have tiny bit flickering with text sometimes, best headset for productivity but it’s still not perfect compared to traditional 4K monitors.


The Digital Crown with immersive environment is probably the most realistic Virtual experience I’ve ever seen, even better than some 4090 powered PCVR mods including those Unreal Engine tech demo, thx to the fantastic Sony micro OLED panel, I wish PCVR can have access to that one day …",231,1bai8b0,virtualreality,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bai8b0,148,1709992415.0

[Long post]Tried Vision Pro. Here's what I thought,"I tried Vision Pro a few days ago. All I can say is, congratulations, if you bought Quest 3, you would get 80% of what vision Pro can offer, if not more.

This is not a review - but this would be a much closer experience than all the guided tour reports Apple carefully curated so far.

After I walk into the room, the Vision Pro is already on the table. I picked up the device, it *feels* like Quest3, with Apple's signature glass and metal. It's heavy, and the shiny front plate is an obvious fingerprint magnet. It's not brand new, so the Rift CV1 style fabric on the eye side feels a little dirty and worn out - keeping it in pristine luxury condition might not be easy. The lenses are smaller than Quest 3 and more squarish, and I feel the field of view is also smaller than Quest 3.

When put on the headset you see the real world, and I was immediately struck by the clarity compared to Quest 3 - but that's expected. Tutorial time - raise your hand and align to instructions, pinch to tap, eye tracking - look at 6 dots and tap to confirm, under 3 lighting conditions. Then log in. You see the Apple logo and then signature Hello, like their WWDC videos.

But there's red fringing on the top and green fringing on the bottom of the apple logo against passthrough background, besides the chromatic aberration on the side of your FOV. Hmm, color fringing? I did not expect this - and this won't be the last.

The ""familiar home menu"" pops up. The screen looks good - no screen door effect, crisp icons and animation activated when I looked at them one by one.

Let me examine this acclaimed video passthrough against glowing reviews.

I looked down at my hands. really great, I can see skin details clearly, no distortions, all as expected. But I glance 15 feet across the room and motion blur of people walking is obvious. Huh. didn't heard people talk about that. And noise - suddenly, it struck me as Quest 3 level, of course better, but not by a mile. Then I look at a display on the desk about 4,5 feet away, the side of display is obviously distorting. that's surprising, since all I heard about was ""Perfect passthrough"". I move my head around, the wobble continued. I looked at my hand again, everything seems fine. I took out my phone and look at it, while clear, some distortion also arised in the middle of the phone. 

And after the initial impressiveness of the VST clarity wears off, the discrepancy of scale was showing up too - it's bigger than real life. I even pulled off the lightseal from the device, so I can see real world above and below with VST in the center of my view. The cut off between virtual and real is jarring, the scale made alignment not possible - unlike even in Quest1, although it had very bad resolution, its passthrough scale is mostly align with the real. This is not what I expected - I planned to marvel at the seamlessness of my hands went from real to virtual, just like 8 years ago with Touch controller of Rift CV1 - but not the case here.

Would this affect me using the device or damaging any confidence when walking around? I don't think so. But it's there.

I try to come up with an explaination for this scale artifact. Maybe their automatic IPD recognition is not that precise. Maybe the 4 years old optometry data for the lens I gave them is a little off for me(but I wear that glass all day). But when I asked somebody else afterwards, the conclusion is the same: Quest has better perspective ratio. So maybe, according to Reality Labs Director of Engineering for XR Tech Ricardo Silveira Cabral - [""The biggest lesson we've learned from Passthrough is that mathematically optimum points don't necessarily mean perceptual optimums,""](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/ai-powered-technologies-quest-3-pro-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses/), and experience matters.

OK, now I understand why people give the passthrough experience of VP a 8.5 but give Quest 3 also a high 7. Last time I saw this rating I thought it's just not making any sense. 

Of course, VST is not easy. This is one of those classic technologies that, when done right, people assume you did nothing. ""Huh? Why not just bump up some resolution? You cheap bastard"" ""Ah it's shit because it's not reality level yet,"" totally ignorant of the technological marvel it is to synthesis a completely new frame for your eye from different camera perspectives, in just a few milliseconds. By the way when I saw the 12 millisecond claim in the keynote, I gasped. Not because of how Apple achieved this, but because of how cleverly they advertised it - people with only a skin-deep understanding of VR would surely remember the 20ms motion-to-photon latency claim, but what Apple did here is photon-to-photon latency, with a fixed algorithm and always on so they can easily accelerate it with a dedicated chip R1. People would definitely conflate those two and news all over claimed Apple reinvented VR - and that's exactly what happened. But if we follow Apple's logic then any optical see-through AR headset could claim 0ms photon-to-photon latency of the real world. Again, Apple is not lying, but dare I say intentionally misleading. Their VR content latency is definitely not 12ms since that would be rendered by the M2 rather than R1 chip - if it were, they would advertise the hell out of that without any asterisk.

The overall feeling of VST is at Quest3 level, stereoscopic 4 million pixels vs 6.5 million for Apple. But Apple's VST seems has higher dynamic range - since there was no additional temporal budget for smart HDR under 12ms constraint, while Quest only uses 1 for each eye, I think AVP uses more cameras, not only capture more information to make up for near field distortion but also at different ISO level to reconstruct the scene at a higher dynamic range.

I turn the dial on my head to enter a VR environment, then look down. My hands are culled out with rough edges, as you may have seen in videos online. My arm with black clothes is also culled out. I take out a phone and put it in my hand, and it becomes part of the VR scene, occluding part of my hand as if I’m holding a cloaking device - but the fingertips are still recognized, impressively.

Now let me examine the screen quality. What better place than the Environments as seen in Apple's trailer? The Environment tab is on the left under Applications and People. There are 13 ""Environments"" with dark/light variants - 8 scenes: Haleakalā, Yosemite, Mount Hood, Joshua Tree, White Sands, the Moon, plus two coming soon; Also 5 color filter ""lights"" - Spring, Summer, Fall Winter, plus Morning - essentially color temperature filters over real life with some sound effects like bird chirps. The main VR environments resemble the photogrammetry Post Cards in Valve's The Lab, both in art style and scene selection. Anyway, they are gorgeous, but with some artificial plastic look up close (like underfoot rocks) typical of photogrammetry. Distant trees can look very 2D. After downloading all available environments, they occupy 1.33GB, on top of the 11.97GB VisionOS.

I opened YouTube in Safari and get into some HDR videos. It's very clear, but I don't feel it's that far above Quest 3 given the higher pixel count implies, there's a bit softness, and I see little difference between choosing 1080p and 1440p in Youtube. Blacks are of course very black, but it's not very bright - contrary to reports of lifelike fire and eye-searing light. This is expected - 5000 nits hitting pancake lenses yields 500 nits if lucky. I also tried finding VR YouTube clips, but there's no forced VR viewing button in Safari like the Meta browser offers.

I also tested eye tracking typing like [MKBHD suggested here](https://youtu.be/dKbT0iFia0I?t=2038) on the virtual keyboard, looking at each letter before tapping as fast as I can - it works, but proves harder than expected. I'm used to glancing, not deliberately focusing. This was unexpected regarding this interface mechanism, and become a pain in the ass as I will explain later. I tried holding a pinch on the timeline to slide left and right, and then looking at specific point on the timeline then tap. All work well as intended, until I finally finished fidgeting around and tried tapping the full-screen button below - I just tapped at the end of the timeline. I tried again, nope. Nearly impossible until I centered my view on that button like early Gear VR with only head aim - finally got it. Forget nonchalantly glancing at the periphery, you have to focus deliberately, defeating eye tracking's purpose here.

Of course, I have to consider if the issue is on my end first, as Apple fans often point out. Maybe the eye registration wasn't quite right causing some mismatch there. And of course if YouTube had a native app, it would follow Apple guidelines like putting small visible buttons inside larger invisible eye tracking zones, as opposed to putting buttons so close that Apple has to determine user intention...and fails.

Eye tracking is a bottomless tech pit once you dig deeper, unlike entitled gamers in the VR community thinking it's just a simple checkbox feature. Wearables are hard given human variability; your eyes change throughout the day and over time. Double the eye tracking cameras didn't ease use or increase tracking volume compared to Quest Pro from the limited time I used - it still notified me when your eyes were too close or far (something to keep in mind if you plan to get your eyes as close to the lenses as possible to maximize FOV), just like Quest Pro. Even after adjustment I'd have to fidget again sometimes - so here goes the advantage of using pancake lenses, or trying to play some fast-motion games.

Bottom line - don't expect a magic end-all solution yet - there's still huge room for improvement. I heard some people even struggled to aim for a button after taking off and putting on the headset again. I happened to notice one time graphics get very pixelated outside foveated regions.

Now I will explain the ""pain in the ass"" part: You know with popups like permission request, ""Yes"" is on the bottom left, and ""No"" on the bottom right. Normally I'd glance through from the top left to the bottom right, then simultaneously click Yes on the bottom left without focusing. Of course that fails here - I mistakenly hit No a few times, which is very annoying. I thought maybe it's just my habit - read casually and decide on the button without a second thought. But afterward talking to another developer porting an app into the device, and when he got the permission pop-up he accidentally denied hand tracking access and had to find the feature and re-enable it in settings, said ""Sigh, there goes at least 10% of consumers.""

In my mind before trying this UX scheme, I thought this would be intuitive and learnable fast. Yet I didn't realize adaptation takes time. You have to know the eye tracking reaction limits and change your information consumption pace and rhythm, and things become more deliberate rather than casual. No wonder Apple is hesitant to add more complex control schemes.


Let's go through the home UI, though I'm sure you've seen plenty of videos/emulator footages already, and this is long enough. Notably there is an Airplane Mode in settings - I didn't try but suppose you have to toggle it manually rather than the system detecting flights. 

My main Quest UI complaint is the 3 app limit Multi-window flexibility - sometimes that's just not enough when juggling between apps and settings. Accidentally replacing a window state brings subtle frustration. Within my VisionOS testing time, supporting more freely placeable windows helped, but issues remained - often when pressing the digital crown to back home, I'd forget my prior home menu browsing state and have to reselect. Probably my habits to blame here and also I haven't gotten familiar enough with the system, but this showed 3D UI design difficulty nonetheless.

I remember the touted Multi-App 3D Engine - the only thing Apple said it's ""first of its kind"" in the whole VisionOS system stack introduction, and it's all about how multiple apps or windows should interact with each other. The transparency seemed beautiful if battery intensive, and from early days alpha testing and blending are a big no no. So I assumed Apple would limit real transparency layers, using UX design tricks like merging non-focused layers into one or only showing near-opaque subtle coloring of the background when multiple layers are view-aligned. Most of the time it's like that, but intentional testing showed 4 transparent content layers plus background impressively, and I can make out the words on each layer, albeit with some frame drops. Shadows are obviously pre-baked so it can only projected onto either desk or floor but not simultaneously. I assume all these default effects including transparency and shadow are handled by R1, since the chip have to reconstruct the scene at all times.


As I pixel-peeping at the content in half-transparent windows and moved my head around, I noticed another thing - motion blur! It's another shock to me, to the point of even a little confusion - chromatic aberration, motion blur - all these ""fixed"" problems from early days, all of sudden reappeared in this flagship VR product from Apple. What happened? This is definitely not within my expectations. But Why didn't I notice it at first? Oh I focused on the VST quality which already has some motion blur artifacts. Also, the high resolution of the screen definitely helped counter these artifacts, and when in VR scenes I didn't notice them at all, but I'm not sure in a fast moving VR game situation it won't be a distraction, which I have no way to test now. My mind was racing with explanations - PSVR2 from Sony also suffers from the same problems, since this micro-oled was also by Sony - an HDR issue? 5000 nits to pancake lenses yields 500 nits if lucky; if adding low persistence that would bring the display to sub 200 nits range. Again, trade offs.

Filming spatial video was easy with the dedicated button on the headset - the depth seems much better than iPhone's camera narrow separation could ever produce, on par with average VR180. The lighting condition here is optimal so I cannot assess other situations but at least the overall quality here is better than I anticipated. The UI also helps a lot - a layer of haze around the content make it felt more like a memory, tapping into cultural sci-fi connections. Besides viewing the video in a window, pressing full screen can make it almost VR180 which do not seem to enlarge the video a lot since the window was already very close to you, but the quality drop is immediate obvious, I can see some color blocks here and there.

The panorama is great, and since most panoramas capture distant scenes, sometimes you would get illusory depth. By the way, I saw people already complain about why Apple cannot just let set panorama as a desktop wallpaper themselves - and I anticipate lots of similar complaints from people that know nothing about the tech and just assume something would work as they imagined.

Though I haven't seen Eyesight on the external display, aiming at people in real life while in VR environment, they would slowly and smoothly fades into VR like showed in promos - nice to have but not that technologically impressive considering what we have today, since it's not about whether other people is looking at you or not, clearly its just analyzing passthrough feed, and fade in people if your aiming happened to locate any human in that direction, nothing about face let alone eye contact recognition as somebody assumed.

The meditation app is simple and relaxing, as an avid practitioner I often prefer no digital help when sitting in a chair for hours straight, but I can see myself using this one.

Battery life matches Quest 3 despite I mostly just did some menu browsing, the most intensive use was the VR environment with a few minutes of Youtube HDR video watching in Safari (Or maybe multi-window interaction in MR?). I intentionally did not charge the device, and there's 30 30-second countdown before it shuts off. 

Taking off the headset, pros are mostly within my expectations, except for cons. The overall sentiments from developers I talked to largely felt the execution was not as high as they imagined - it's essentially a higher-spec Quest 3.



Zuckerberg said **there's no kind of magical solution that Apple has to any of the constraints on laws and physics that our teams haven't already explored and thought of**, and that's truer than ever after I used AVP for half of the day. By the standard of this device, if Apple produced a headset that is exactly like Quest3, they would sell it at least $2000, which is actually fair if you compare Quest to any other consumer electronics on the market, in terms of hardware spec, R&D tech, and cost packed in. That's not counting any contents in the library that Meta has accumulated all these years.

I remember when I watched the WWDC keynote last year, I had certain fuzzy anticipations since I discarded all the rumors about the dual M2 chips or 8k displays, which based on my understanding of the industry, are ultra bullshit. But indeed, Apple did come out with another approach - using R1 to process all the sensor data and SLAM, scene reconstruction, even pre-baked all the spatial effects for apps, and leaving M2 for all the general tasks. Still, using a GPU at most 1.7x XR2Gen2 but having to render more than 2.5x pixel count compared to Quest3 is not ideal, so they also packed in foveated rendering, and urged developers to mostly work for AR instead of ""full screen"" VR, thus easing the rendering pressure for M2, emphasizing on the CPU side of things, which is the strong suit right now for Apple's chips. From this computing structure perspective, it's really an AR device, but unfortunately it did not get rid of any pitfalls of the VR devices today. It's still very heavy, in fact heavier than Quest 3 even without battery, and its battery lasts on par with Quest 3, despite having at least double the raw capacity. So the question is: what advantages do you get for Vision Pro? Can it stand as a first gen product?

I have my doubts. Looking back at iPhone1, you can actually see some parallel: for that product in 2007, they mostly focused on the multi-touch interface, and maybe ""wasted"" a lot of computing power and battery on a 1300mAh device solely for that feature. Similarly, Vision Pro has so many sensors to make sure your eyes and hands are captured to the point of some people might think is overkill. But from the perspective of UX design, the basic input mechanism should leave no room for frustration. It's just this time, against the much variability and volatility of the human body and real world situations, the end result leaves me wondering if it's worth it. Granted, for average people it won't be much of a problem, it's just you can easily get frustrated by the limitations of what current tech is capable of providing. They used much higher specs to compensate for the lack today, but even discounting the price, the weight, thermal, and battery life are all trade-offs compared to Quest 3, which I'm not sure a well-informed and non-biased person would pay. And for the battery itself - if you have to put this battery in your pocket all the time since Gen1, what kind of battery should you use following its trend? History told us it can only go up, like we have 5000mAh smartphones today. Or maybe AVP Is really just a laptop and we have to attach to a power cord all day.

Of course, one of the biggest arguments is display. Can these devices replace your monitor? I think the line is very blurry here since both Q3 and AVP surpassed the usable line and it would finally comes down to people's preference: the Vision Pro's screen doesn't have screen-door effect, but also don't expect 4K HDR as the overall quality is closer to a cheap 1440p HDR display when simulating a screen, some subtle motion blur, more vivid color, very nice close-up passthrough, narrower FOV, while Quest 3 has a slight screen-door effect, lower resolution, worse color, more true-to-life scale of the passthrough, and is lighter. Overall obviously VP's display is a net win, but If you take weight into consideration, I would rather use my laptop or 4K projector when doing long work session or media viewing, and that's the whole point of VP's existence.

Everyone has a different answer, but everything considered, I found myself leaning towards Quest 3 more - even though I think my digital lifestyle may fit more toward what Apple suggested here - I can just lie down and watch YouTube all day long for months straight and I've used Oculus Go to watch YouTube until 5AM, but it's not something enticing to wear a headset. Viewing webpages while scrolling with my hand on my leg without moving much is nice, but my head would also suffers more weight. And I can do most of the 3D things in Quest 3 with controllers better. I love VR and put a lot of time thinking about it, so I know the pattern after novelty wears off.

For Quest 3, I think Meta has the right power distribution among all the necessary features, constantly iterates on the minimal usable experimental features without stepping up too much - it's like yeah better mixed reality is nice, but is that 1 hour less battery and 100 grams more nice?. You can always add in a battery pack later for Q3, on your head for balancing or in your pocket just like Vision Pro. Right now Meta could accelerate on bringing more productivity apps (translation: 2D apps) into their ecosystem now, as the resolution is finally caught up to make it useful. Palmer Luckey said you have to make a headset everybody wants before everybody can buy, which I agree partially, because ultimately you are not just building a headset, you are also building the entire ecosystem, which consists of developers, supply chain, and consumers. Unlike Apple, Meta does not have the luxury of any existing platform, so they had to bootstrap the whole ecosystem one by one and do not skip any intermediate steps. If they sell expensive, they won't sell many and fewer devs would buy in to develop for the device, and even fewer people would buy and fewer quantity means components become more expensive, so the price would go up…few people understand this and just whiny for certain better specs. Fortunately, this tipping point is coming, and right now Meta could be even more aggressive; Apple certainly could bring more mainstream attention into this field that we all love.

Anyway, I'm excited for the future, for anyone out there, manage your expectations, be patient, on this road of realizing the dream of ""being anyone, go anywhere, do anything"".

Vision Pro is not dead,"I have seen a lot of chatter online with some people thinking/worrying that Apple isn’t fully invested in Vision Pro and Vision OS…

A friend of mine is a manager at an Apple Store, and has worked for Apple for over 15 years now.

We were talking about WWDC and what we expected see, when another friend asked about how the Vision Pro was doing (in terms of sales and popularity).

He said that even though sales projections were decreased for 2024, Apple is still pushing the Vision Pro pretty hard.

He mentioned that Apple is aiming to get more people into demos, because after two demos most people are blown away and make a purchase. He said they would rather make an iPhone customer wait longer in order to put more employee resources behind providing demos of the AVP.

He also said that during EVERY employee meeting the Vision Pro is talked about and is always a hot topic. Which he said I s unlike any other product that’s been released under his time at Apple.  

So hopefully this little tidbit of info helps put to rest any concerns of Apple’s commitment to making this product line work.

It sounds like we have a bright future ahead for Vision Pro and I’m super excited for Vision OS 2.0 and above 💪🏻",182,1db1vgf,VisionPro,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1db1vgf/vision_pro_is_not_dead/,195,1717849781.0

iPad Pro M4 13 Inch or Apple Vision Pro?,In the UK we are getting the Vision Pro next month. I currently have no computer as I always change up things. I was looking at getting the iPad with the magic keyboard as my full time computer but at its price with just a grand more I can get into the Vision Pro. My work load is not heavy at all hence my decision to use an iPad. I just want the best hardware and experience. What should I do? Save the money and get a “boring iPad” or get into the future of computing. ,154,1dhjfez,iPadPro,https://i.redd.it/ip9djtzfi07d1.jpeg,208,1718577900.0

"I don’t understand people saying the Vision/VisionPro will one day be $1,000","I see it thrown out there all the time on Reddit, but anyone waiting for a $1,000 Vision or VisionPro is going to be waiting forever.

The iPhone 15 retails at nearly $1,000, yet the VisionPro has *8x as many pixels* squeezed into tiny specialty displays, *4x as many cameras* including specialty cameras like LIDAR, an M2 processor *and* a new R1 chip, and who knows how much more glass metal and fabric.

I don’t think people throwing around a $1,000 future price tag truly understand how much is under the hood of the VisionPro. They should be thinking in terms of MacBook/MacBookPro pricing.

Unity drama will probably kill the Apple Vision Pro,"[Apple partnered with Unity](https://blog.unity.com/engine-platform/unity-support-for-visionos) to create Polyspacial, a system for developing on the Apple Vision Pro. The problem is, pretty much [all devs have been outraged by the new fee structure](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/sep/12/unity-engine-fees-backlash-response) (charging 20 cents for every download) and many have declared an intention to leave Unity for other platforms and even delete their games altogether. 

The main alternative is the Unreal Engine by Epic Games. Epic Games had [a huge lawsuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games_v._Apple#Decision) with Apple because Epic didn't like the Apple tax on their App Store revenue. 

So Apple Vision Pro will have basically no devs for their platform just as they need them to create apps to make this hunk of overpriced glass and aluminium worth buying.

The Vision Pro Makes me sad..," As Heavy High end pcvr guy , the vision pro just makes me angry that we can't seem to get two things that go together. 

I've invested way too much money to get the best experience from VR, 4090 , Crystal, currently but have owned Aero, (kx, g2 ,Vive pro 2 etc...you get it. I've had every iteration of the quest. Yay. 

Having the Vision Pro for 3 days now, seeing how great an actual is for vr/are is vs Android based Launcher or terrible PC front end software..... The biggest hurdle to VR, just getting into the environment is essentially removed, amazing screens, amazing battery life, etc from a company THAT DOESN'T LET YOU GAMEON IT. 

So over here we have super expensive PC with wired headset and bugs, and friction. OR standalone quest, which (while admittedly great for the money) with laggy software and not quite pcvr level games. On the other hand, we have a company who put out something on their first effort that kind of puts all of this other stuff to shame, had the capability to play pcvr level games BUT the company doesn't want you to use it for that..


Seems like we can't ever get two things that go together.

Vision Pro is AMAZING,"The vision pro is amazing, and Ive had every single Oculus and Meta headset ever made. This is absolutely on another league.

First the nitpiks: 1) the fov is awful, it needs a much wider fov to be fully immersive but thankfully, you only notice when you first put it on and once you get into your apps, you mostly forget about it unless you look. Edit: From reading other posts, its seems that the poor FOV might improve with a different lightseal. My light seal was a 35W which I think is the worst one for FOV.

2) the external camera pass through quality seems quite poor, the real world around you feels dull and washed out when wearing it whereas the environments look stunning and lifelike so the displays arent the issue, the camera feed is. Its  better than the quest 3s cameras but much worse than the environments so probably a technological limitation on how how high quality realtime zero latency video can get.

3) the solo loop band is worthless for longer than 10 mins, the dual loop band is way more comfy and should be the default.

All that said, the nitpicks are not deal breakers and will definitely improve in the gen 2 version. The important thing is that the visual fidelity of the display is life like, watching movies on it is better than the cinema and the ability to mirror your mac and get work done on a gigantic screen is an actual killer app imo. Apple nailed the UI and controls. This is the future and in our lifetime, this tech will absolutely be as ubiquitous as the iphone.

EDIT, 2 more Nitpiks:

1. There needs to be a Movie Mode and also a Bed Mode like another user posted that you can only exit by physically pressing either button above. Movie watching is a killer app but the stupid interface popping on anytime you move your hands is extremely annoying.

2. Please work with the devs to add in support  WebXR and OpenXR/MR and release a DeoVR app. Its a universal standard and its a shame its not supported yet in day one.

Lastly, does anyone know how to get vr videos you already have on your PC onto the Vision Pro? Is there an app yet that lets you download and watch videos off of your PC?",189,1aim6ah,VisionPro,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1aim6ah/vision_pro_is_amazing/,139,1707047277.0

ANNAPRO's Second-gen Comfort Head Strap Design for Apple Vision Pro - We Need Your Feedback!,"Hey folks!

It's been three months since we rolled out our [first-gen Comfort Head Strap for the Apple Vision Pro](https://annapro.com/products/comfort-support-strap-for-apple-vision-pro?from=reddit_gen2_feedback_post), and we've been stoked by the positive feedback! Many of you have proven that it really helps ease the pressure on the face. But we also heard from some of you with larger heads that the strap was a bit snug. So, we've gone back to the drawing board and come up with a new design, and we’d love to get your thoughts!

Here are the key updates:

**1. Better Adjustability:**

For those with larger heads, we've added an adjustable panel with a foam pad. This panel uses a ""ball-and-socket"" mechanism, allowing forward and backward adjustments while staying stable. We also slimmed down the sides to allow about 0.5 cm of front-to-back movement, which helps with eye-tracking adjustments.

**2. Height Upgrade:**

We've increased the strap's overall height for a more comfortable fit. This prevents the AVP from sitting too high and lets users switch to thicker cushions for extra comfort.

**3. Improved Materials:**

We’re planning to switch from the original leather to ice silk material for the foam cushions. The leather could get a bit sweaty, so the ice silk should be way more comfortable, especially in the summer.

**4. Integrated Battery:**

We’ve built the battery into the head strap to balance the weight better and reduce the risk of dropping the main unit. The battery is magnetically detachable and can be swapped out easily, so no more lugging around a huge power bank.

**5. Gear Adjustment:**

Similar to the Meta Quest head strap design, our new strap can be adjusted and tightened with gears, making it easier to get the perfect fit.

These are our ideas for the next-gen Vision Pro head strap, and we can’t wait to hear what you think. Your feedback is super important to us and helps us make our products better.

Thanks in advance for your input!

Cheers,

The ANNAPRO Team

"Apple Unveils Vision Pro AR/VR Headset, Its First Major New Product In Nearly A Decade","On Monday, Apple unveiled its much-anticipated mixed reality headset, the Vision Pro, the tech giant’s first major new product category since 2015’s Apple Watch.

The new device, packed with cameras and sensors, looks like a futuristic pair of ski goggles, and can immerse a wearer in virtual reality but also blend in the real-world elements of augmented reality. CEO Tim Cook announced the new product at the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference held at its sparkling Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino, CA.

Apple’s virtual reality plans date back roughly a decade, and Cook has been teasing his ambitions publicly for the better part of that time. As far back as 2016, the company filed patents for lightweight eyeglasses and a bulkier device. But while Cook reportedly preferred the more compact option, according to reports by Bloomberg, the technical challenge forced Apple to change its strategy.

The device announcement comes years after other Silicon Valley juggernauts including Meta and Google parent Alphabet have tried to bring high-tech headsets into the mainstream. Facebook in 2014 bought the startup Oculus for $2 billion and has released two generations of its Meta Quest, geared mostly toward gamers. Microsoft in 2016 made a big bet on its Hololens headset, a 3D augmented reality device, but has failed to gain traction with consumers. Google made the buzziest splash more than a decade ago with its disastrous Google Glass, a sleek headset with a camera on board. The product drew immediate outrage, with early adopters dubbed “glassholes.”

Apple has rarely been first to new product categories, instead letting other companies take the lead while it developed products it hoped could dominate over rivals. Apple was beat to market in mp3 players, smartphones, tablets and smartwatches, but its iPods, iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches have all become category-defining devices.

Apple will have a bigger challenge ahead as it asks people to put its latest product directly on their faces for everyday use—an aim which has eluded all its well-capitalized predecessors. Today’s headsets often lead to people complaining about the devices overheating, being too heavy to wear for too long or leaving sweaty foreheads. Others have found the experience of being disconnected to the real world—immersed in full-on virtual reality for long periods of time—too isolating. Cook said in an interview with GQ earlier this year that Apple’s device could increase collaboration, though Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision to achieve a similar effect in the workplace has failed to take off.

"Currently, what's the point of the Apple Vision Pro?","Apparently it's not for gaming. That leaves its biggest use scenarios to be either the consumption of media, or productivity. 

Productivity wise, there's only so long you can take with a heavy headset strapped to your face. Even if you work from home, you certainly won't be spending all day walking around the house with it like its a pair of Raybans because while it is lighter than the quest 3, it's still about a pound of weight on your face. Not to mention you'd be wired to an external battery, which would probably be kind of annoying. You can't be using it outdoors much either because, looking goofy aside, just like the quest 3, it's pancake lenses are vulnerable to damage from sunlight.

That leaves the vision pro to be used as some sort of personal cinema or portable huge screen, for which it's M2 chip is completely overkill for. 
The problem is that it uses the same pancake lenses as the quest 3. The same lenses that many say have too much glare/ghosting when there's a bright scene in a darker background. More info about the nature of pancake lenses here: https://pimax.com/aspheric-vs-pancake-vr-lenses-and-why-glass/

Personally, I don't even enjoy my quest 3 when it comes to watching media for that reason. Pancake lens glare is inevitable and looks like this, even on the $1000 Bigscreen Beyond: https://youtu.be/pQzSb_JPH5Y?si=tMsJR1I1shrjo3Xt&t=1157

It doesn't matter that the resolution is 2.5 times of the quest 3 if you're going to be getting the same distracting amount of glare and ghosting on anything that looks bright. Consuming media on a $3500 85inch qled 4k tv would be more enjoyable since the image would be absolutely crystal clear, and there's nothing weighing on your face so it's way more comfortable for long viewing sessions. Either way you'll probably be using it at home so the form factor isn't so much the issue. 

So really, what is appeal of the $3500 vision pro? If they sold a Quest 3 that's as light as sunglasses you can wear around all day, with crystal clear optics and a huge immersive FOV, I might say it's worth the price of seven quest 3s. But right now, what's the point of it? 

Sure it has an m2 chip that's Macbook standard, but how is someone going to take full advantage of that with all the other constraints? 

Surely no one is going to use eye and hand tracking controls to edit videos, audio, graphic design, or whatever it is people buy Macbooks for right? (I wouldn't know, always been a windows laptop/desktop user). 

Attaching a bunch of wireless accessories like a keyboard and mouse would also kind of diminish the point of having a fully portable hands free spatial computer on your face.",154,194s7t3,virtualreality,https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/194s7t3/currently_whats_the_point_of_the_apple_vision_pro/,543,1705056361.0
