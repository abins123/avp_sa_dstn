"I’ve had the Quest 3 for about 6 months. I picked up an Apple Vision Pro 10 days ago with the idea of trying it but then returning it in 14 days. My main use is for media and social media consumption.

Comparing it to the Quest 3 quality wise, I see the quest 3 as version 1 and AVP as version 5. It is that much better. The movie and tv series experience is better than movie theatre quality. Since I’ve been using the AVP I no longer want to use my top of the line OLED and soundbar system.

Now I’m debating keeping it. The cost of a really good tv and soundbar is about $3500+. Same price and better experience plus you can do lots of other things with it.

Apple knocked this one out of the park.

Edit: I shamefully forgot to mention sports watching. Another next level experience. ",price,"Task:  atsc

"Got an AVP demo at the Apple store today… and all I can think is thank God I saved my money. 

I’ll start with the bad

Hand tracking has serious latency issues, q3 actually has equivalent or better hand tracking imo. I had quite a few missed taps and moving my hands around with something virtual tracking them showed that there’s at least 60-100ms of latency for hand tracking. 

Eye tracking either has minor latency issues or the responsiveness of highlighting is messed up. Psvr2 has quicker and more accurate eye tracking imo. 

The fov is god awful. I think my original vive had better fov, it can’t be more than 70-80 degrees based on what I experienced. You get used to it pretty quickly but there was major shock having played my q3 immediately before. Undoubtedly they play it safe with the closeness of the headset for demos, and this would improve from getting the lenses closer, but this was my experience and the lenses are very small compared to others on the market now. (Had to edit this)

The brightness is extremely lacking, pass through feels like you’re wearing sunglasses. 

We’re still far away from “wow I can’t tell I’m wearing a headset” level pass through. They managed to eliminate the wavy outlines that occur in quest pass through when you hold your hand or phone up, but whatever they did to fix this made depth perception difficult. 

3D videos taken on the avp look like they’re recorded in 720p, although the vids taken from iPhone were actually quite impressive. 

The occlusion with your hands being visible in environments is the best I’ve seen, but it’s still far from perfect. Tons of edges peeking through. 

It is wildly uncomfortable, major pressure on my forehead and considering maybe 100,000 people bought one at most, there’s not going to be any 3rd party facial interfaces. 

Now for some good, I’ll give credit where credit is due. 
Resolution is stunning, best I’ve seen, but that’s also with a small field of view so…. PPD is artificially increased by that. 

8k high framerate vr videos look AMAZING, this is the one thing i say they’ve done absolutely incredibly. Movies look good too and you can really see the detail. 

Rendered things such as environments and the Dino demo look STUNNING like… as good or better than pc graphics. 

The windows do stay put and the shadows are cool. 


TLDR; it’s about 50% better than the quest 3 in terms of the overall experience, but 700% more expensive, and without controllers or games, they really shit themselves on this one. Tons of potential, most of it missed. I would not want to use this for anything productive, it’s majorly uncomfortable, and productivity is the only use case I could possibly see with this device. I’d maybe pay $300 for this, not 3500. For the price of a Varjo headset, I expect to be blown away at everything, but it’s just a good bit better than other hmds at certain things, and drastically lacking in other departments.

"and it wasn’t as bad as you’d think.

Comfortability:
Note that I did not take the headset off at all during the 8 hours.
Against the advice of the greater group, I did this experiment with the solo knit band because for me, it’s the best looking and easiest to use.
It wasn’t comfortable but it also wasn’t painful until about 6 hours in. The pain was centered around the back of my head from the pressure of the band (no, I didn’t have it that tight). My face never really felt any pain, just general discomfort. In general, I got used to the discomfort an hour or two in so it was totally manageable.

Software Bugs:
Around hour 7, I started experiencing some serious bugs. Things like apps not responding to input, apps hanging and then crashing, physical buttons not responding, apps not launching, significant lag, and visual bugs (windows flashing and disappearing). I was using VisionOS 1.0.2.

Battery:
I started with 100% battery, ran down to 10%, charged back up to 100%, ran back down to 40%, and then charged back up to 100% before the end of the experiment. So total usage during the 8 hours was 150% (although that does not include energy used while charging, which is why it is so low)

What did I do for eight hours?
I just did my computer desk job as normal through the passthrough cameras. It did take some time to get used to since the cameras are obviously not as crisp as real life, but after a few hours I didn’t have a problem reading off my monitors. Unfortunately, I couldn’t use Teams or any O365 app on the AVP because there’s no way my org is going to allow me to sign in on an unmanaged device.
It was awesome to be able to respond to texts and emails on the AVP without having to move my hand far from my mouse or even pick up my phone.

Taking it off:
Idk what I was expecting when I took it off but it was pretty anti-climatic. I didn’t have the dramatic response to the rapid increase in FOV and clarity that I was expecting. But a couple hours later and I can still feel a phantom pressure on my cheeks from the light seal cushion. Also, my eyes do feel a bit weird now and my depth perception is also the tiniest bit off. 

Conclusion:
Did I gain any significant advantage for doing my job through an AVP? Probably not. Was it cool? Absolutely.",design,"Task:  atsc

Mode set to:  Individual sample inference
Running inference on input:  and it wasn’t as bad as you’d think.

Comfortability:
Note that I did not take the headset off at all during the 8 hours.
Against the advice of the greater group, I did this experiment with the solo knit band because for me, it’s the best looking and easiest to use.
It wasn’t comfortable but it also wasn’t painful until about 6 hours in. The pain was centered around the back of my head from the pressure of the band (no, I didn’t have it that tight). My face never really felt any pain, just general discomfort. In general, I got used to the discomfort an hour or two in so it was totally manageable.

Software Bugs:
Around hour 7, I started experiencing some serious bugs. Things like apps not responding to input, apps hanging and then crashing, physical buttons not responding, apps not launching, significant lag, and visual bugs (windows flashing and disappearing). I was using VisionOS 1.0.2.

Battery:
I started with 100% battery, ran down to 10%, charged back up to 100%, ran back down to 40%, and then charged back up to 100% before the end of the experiment. So total usage during the 8 hours was 150% (although that does not include energy used while charging, which is why it is so low)

What did I do for eight hours?
I just did my computer desk job as normal through the passthrough cameras. It did take some time to get used to since the cameras are obviously not as crisp as real life, but after a few hours I didn’t have a problem reading off my monitors. Unfortunately, I couldn’t use Teams or any O365 app on the AVP because there’s no way my org is going to allow me to sign in on an unmanaged device.
It was awesome to be able to respond to texts and emails on the AVP without having to move my hand far from my mouse or even pick up my phone.

Taking it off:
Idk what I was expecting when I took it off but it was pretty anti-climatic. I didn’t have the dramatic response to the rapid increase in FOV and clarity that I was expecting. But a couple hours later and I can still feel a phantom pressure on my cheeks from the light seal cushion. Also, my eyes do feel a bit weird now and my depth perception is also the tiniest bit off.

"So I’ve been playing around using my Apple Vision Pro as a virtual screen for Traktor at home. 

I recorded a sick four deck stems drum and bass demo to show you guys, but stupidly the AVP didn’t record any audio so you can’t get the full experience. 

I wasn’t going to upload it (especially since the first person POV is kind of nauseating to watch), but u/astromech_dj ‘s latest article on Rogue DJs sparked my interest and u/youngtankred encouraged me to post it anyway. 

While you can’t get much from the video, and I would never buy an AVP just for this purpose, it is absolutely awesome to have a big virtual screen like this right in your face without the need for a big monitor. 

In fact I sold my big display monitor that I often used for work here (laptop sitting on top of the deck saver for the mixer) and use the AVP almost exclusively for a large laptop display now. 

At the price it doesn’t make sense (and work bought it anyway), but as the price comes down I think it will become a more and more viable solution. It’s nothing like VR DJing at all, and right now is basically just a monitor replacement, but you can see how having virtual record boxes, effects and so on will evolve over time.

TLDR - You are not missing out on much.

Gonna do a quick numbered comparison AVP to Q3 - More thoughts in a later post just wanted to let everyone know they are not missing out on much.

AVP:

10/10 Resolution

10/10 Color

9/10 User experience 

3/10 Weight on face

5/10 FOV 


Q3:

7/10 Resolution

5/10 Color

8/10 User Experience 

9/10 Weight on face

8/10 FOV

Why do I say you are not missing out on much? 

The pixel smear is horrendous. Apple didn’t solve OLED Mura/Pixel smear and it is extremely off putting and disorienting to turn your head just a little to fast. Not even that fast, just a little fast. Like normal head turning speed.

I would wait for Q Pro 2 if you were looking to upgrade. If Apple can’t solve the pixel smear/mura of OLED tech then no one can. The Quantum dot mini-LED LCD tech of Q Pro 1 was the true king. The only disappointing thing about the Q Pro 1 was the resolution - which Q3 improved but it was sadly LCD so colors/dynamic range were a downgrade over Q Pro.

Also, the “180 3D 8k” immersive experiences are more like 160. And half of the scenes are lowered FOV. Prob about 120-130, not much but it takes away from the immersion when you can’t see the ground or sky completely when you look 100% up, down, left, right.

Although the sharpness at that resolution with the AVP panels is jaw dropping, the pixel smear is horrendous.

Also, my eyeballs are already tired from having to physically look at every thing I’m clicking, instead of just using my hands or controllers to point.

Gonna get right to work on mastering my Q2/Q3 immersive 180 3D 8k experiences for AVP. Someone’s gotta put some decent 180 content out there for everyone if Apples gonna drop the ball on it. They should call it Apple 160 3D 8k experiences.

Edit: It’s ridiculously heavy. Nothing like how light Q3 is, so it’s a bit uncomfortable.

FOV is lower than Q2 on Vertical axis and about the same FOV as Q2 on horizontal axis. You read that right it’s lower that Q2 (Q3 is higher FOV for all axis)

Edit 2: The small oval FOV isn’t even fully usable, because if you look close to the edges of the FOV there is distortion and color shift on the last 5-10 degrees. The lenses themselves are distorting it. No edge to edge clarity like Q3.

Edit 3: Holy hell the glare on this is terrible. There is a lot of glare on the lens when using the web. Not something that can be fixed with a software update.",price,"Task:  atsc

"""*Apple Inc. began taking preorders for its long-awaited Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Friday, and early indications suggest that buyers are snapping up initial supplies of the $3,499 device.* 
  

  
*The product went on sale at 8 a.m. Eastern time on Apple’s website and mobile app, ahead of its rollout on Feb. 2. Delivery dates for all three models quickly slipped to March 8-15 for online orders, and the device was sold out for in-store pickup on day one at many locations. The delay signals that either demand is strong or supplies are limited — or something in between.*

*Apple shares gained as much as 1.8% to $191.95 Friday in New York, erasing most of its 2% decline for January.* 
  

  
*With the launch, the company disclosed two additional configurations: a version with 512 gigabytes of storage for $3,699, and a top-end model with 1 terabyte of space for $3,899. The base model includes 256 gigabytes of storage. The company also said it would sell a carrying case for $199 and additional batteries for $199, while extra bands will cost $99 a piece.* 
  

  
*The purchasing process for the Vision Pro is unique. Customers need to use a recent iPhone or iPad to scan their head and, if necessary, provide a vision prescription. Apple typically doesn’t comment on the sales performance of new products.*
  
*Wall Street analysts are predicting a slow start for the device. UBS Group AG analyst David Vogt expects Apple to ship 300,000 to 400,000 units this year, generating as much as $1.4 billion. For a company that had sales of $383 billion last year, that’s “immaterial.”*

*Still, the idea is to set the stage for something bigger. Apple is entering its first major new product category since the company began selling smartwatches in 2015, and the Vision Pro may take years to catch on. Apple will continue to refine the headset — making it cheaper and more comfortable — and find compelling applications for the device.*
  

  
*In the longer run, Apple could use a fresh moneymaker. The smartphone market has matured, and it’s under particular pressure in China. The company’s revenue has fallen for four straight quarters — its longest streak of declines in more than two decades.*

*Initially, the Cupertino, California-based company only plans to sell the Vision Pro in the US, with launches in other markets coming in the months ahead. The company is eyeing the UK, Canada and China as some of the first other countries, Bloomberg News has reported.*
  

  
*It’s a complex product to manufacture, which could limit early supplies. The dual 4K resolution displays in the headset, which melds virtual and augmented reality, have suffered production snags. But the fact that Apple has been ramping up manufacturing for months suggests that it will be able to satisfy initial demand. The company is also offering a 25% discount on the device for employees, signaling that supplies aren’t too tight.*

*Inside Apple, executives are anticipating a strong opening weekend, with sales tapering off later. At $3,499, the Vision Pro is one of the priciest consumer headsets ever — about seven times more expensive than the latest device from VR market leader Meta Platforms Inc.*
  

  
*The Vision Pro also will be a hard product to share with family and friends. It requires a precise fitting process to ensure a good experience. The face scan is designed to determine the best light seal and strap size for users. The company has prepared 25 different light seals — a cushion that prevents light from seeping into the wearer’s field of view — in addition to two straps. There also are prescription lens inserts, at an additional cost.* 
  

  
*And the headset may be hard for some people to wear for extended periods. In early testing, some users have found it to be too heavy.*
  

  
*Another concern that’s cropped up in recent days is a lack of support from top streaming apps. Netflix Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Google’s YouTube are opting not to release software for the device, at least at launch.*
  

  
*But Apple has carefully refined its sales pitch for the headset. When consumers try it out at Apple retail stores, they’ll get a 25-minute demo, letting them get comfortable with the 3D experience that the company calls “spatial computing.”*
  

  
*To commemorate the launch, Apple executives Mike Rockwell and Alan Dye discussed the device in a Q&A shared with employees this week.*
  

  
*A key focus, said Dye, was ensuring that the Vision Pro didn’t have a closed-in feel — a complaint with VR headsets.*
  

  
*“From the onset, we all had concerns about people sitting with their eyes covered and disconnected from the world,” he said. “It really became central to how we thought about the core principles of the product.”*
  

  
*That led to the EyeSight system, which can show a wearer’s eyes through a screen on the front of the Vision Pro. “It was a huge technical challenge to do this in a way that looks and feels natural,” Rockwell said.*
  

  
*Apple also developed an interface that doesn’t require handheld accessories. Instead, it tracks eye movement and hand gestures. Users control the device by looking at an on-screen item and pinching their fingers together to select it.*
  

  
*One of the biggest selling points may be how easy it makes collaboration, Rockwell said. Users in far-flung locations can feel like they’re in the same place.*
  

  
*“It’s the closest thing to being there in person that you can possibly have,” Rockwell said. “It changes the way you collaborate and is very different from videoconferencing as we know it.”*

Running inference on input:  ""*Apple Inc. began taking preorders for its long-awaited Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Friday, and early indications suggest that buyers are snapping up initial supplies of the $3,499 device.* 
  

  
*The product went on sale at 8 a.m. Eastern time on Apple’s website and mobile app, ahead of its rollout on Feb. 2. Delivery dates for all three models quickly slipped to March 8-15 for online orders, and the device was sold out for in-store pickup on day one at many locations. The delay signals that either demand is strong or supplies are limited — or something in between.*

*Apple shares gained as much as 1.8% to $191.95 Friday in New York, erasing most of its 2% decline for January.* 
  

  
*With the launch, the company disclosed two additional configurations: a version with 512 gigabytes of storage for $3,699, and a top-end model with 1 terabyte of space for $3,899. The base model includes 256 gigabytes of storage. The company also said it would sell a carrying case for $199 and additional batteries for $199, while extra bands will cost $99 a piece.* 
  

  
*The purchasing process for the Vision Pro is unique. Customers need to use a recent iPhone or iPad to scan their head and, if necessary, provide a vision prescription. Apple typically doesn’t comment on the sales performance of new products.*
  
*Wall Street analysts are predicting a slow start for the device. UBS Group AG analyst David Vogt expects Apple to ship 300,000 to 400,000 units this year, generating as much as $1.4 billion. For a company that had sales of $383 billion last year, that’s “immaterial.”*

*Still, the idea is to set the stage for something bigger. Apple is entering its first major new product category since the company began selling smartwatches in 2015, and the Vision Pro may take years to catch on. Apple will continue to refine the headset — making it cheaper and more comfortable — and find compelling applications for the device.*
  

  
*In the longer run, Apple could use a fresh moneymaker. The smartphone market has matured, and it’s under particular pressure in China. The company’s revenue has fallen for four straight quarters — its longest streak of declines in more than two decades.*

*Initially, the Cupertino, California-based company only plans to sell the Vision Pro in the US, with launches in other markets coming in the months ahead. The company is eyeing the UK, Canada and China as some of the first other countries, Bloomberg News has reported.*
  

  
*It’s a complex product to manufacture, which could limit early supplies. The dual 4K resolution displays in the headset, which melds virtual and augmented reality, have suffered production snags. But the fact that Apple has been ramping up manufacturing for months suggests that it will be able to satisfy initial demand. The company is also offering a 25% discount on the device for employees, signaling that supplies aren’t too tight.*

*Inside Apple, executives are anticipating a strong opening weekend, with sales tapering off later. At $3,499, the Vision Pro is one of the priciest consumer headsets ever — about seven times more expensive than the latest device from VR market leader Meta Platforms Inc.*
  

  
*The Vision Pro also will be a hard product to share with family and friends. It requires a precise fitting process to ensure a good experience. The face scan is designed to determine the best light seal and strap size for users. The company has prepared 25 different light seals — a cushion that prevents light from seeping into the wearer’s field of view — in addition to two straps. There also are prescription lens inserts, at an additional cost.* 
  

  
*And the headset may be hard for some people to wear for extended periods. In early testing, some users have found it to be too heavy.*
  

  
*Another concern that’s cropped up in recent days is a lack of support from top streaming apps. Netflix Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Google’s YouTube are opting not to release software for the device, at least at launch.*
  

  
*But Apple has carefully refined its sales pitch for the headset. When consumers try it out at Apple retail stores, they’ll get a 25-minute demo, letting them get comfortable with the 3D experience that the company calls “spatial computing.”*
  

  
*To commemorate the launch, Apple executives Mike Rockwell and Alan Dye discussed the device in a Q&A shared with employees this week.*
  

  
*A key focus, said Dye, was ensuring that the Vision Pro didn’t have a closed-in feel — a complaint with VR headsets.*
  

  
*“From the onset, we all had concerns about people sitting with their eyes covered and disconnected from the world,” he said. “It really became central to how we thought about the core principles of the product.”*
  

  
*That led to the EyeSight system, which can show a wearer’s eyes through a screen on the front of the Vision Pro. “It was a huge technical challenge to do this in a way that looks and feels natural,” Rockwell said.*
  

  
*Apple also developed an interface that doesn’t require handheld accessories. Instead, it tracks eye movement and hand gestures. Users control the device by looking at an on-screen item and pinching their fingers together to select it.*
  

  
*One of the biggest selling points may be how easy it makes collaboration, Rockwell said. Users in far-flung locations can feel like they’re in the same place.*
  

  
*“It’s the closest thing to being there in person that you can possibly have,” Rockwell said. “It changes the way you collaborate and is very different from videoconferencing as we know it.”*

2. The best video passthrough we’ve seen yet is on Vision Pro.

"I’ve had the Quest 3 for about 6 months. I picked up an Apple Vision Pro 10 days ago with the idea of trying it but then returning it in 14 days. My main use is for media and social media consumption.

Comparing it to the Quest 3 quality wise, I see the quest 3 as version 1 and AVP as version 5. It is that much better. The movie and tv series experience is better than movie theatre quality. Since I’ve been using the AVP I no longer want to use my top of the line OLED and soundbar system.

Now I’m debating keeping it. The cost of a really good tv and soundbar is about $3500+. Same price and better experience plus you can do lots of other things with it.

Apple knocked this one out of the park.

Edit: I shamefully forgot to mention sports watching. Another next level experience. ",price,"Task:  atsc

"Got an AVP demo at the Apple store today… and all I can think is thank God I saved my money. 

I’ll start with the bad

Hand tracking has serious latency issues, q3 actually has equivalent or better hand tracking imo. I had quite a few missed taps and moving my hands around with something virtual tracking them showed that there’s at least 60-100ms of latency for hand tracking. 

Eye tracking either has minor latency issues or the responsiveness of highlighting is messed up. Psvr2 has quicker and more accurate eye tracking imo. 

The fov is god awful. I think my original vive had better fov, it can’t be more than 70-80 degrees based on what I experienced. You get used to it pretty quickly but there was major shock having played my q3 immediately before. Undoubtedly they play it safe with the closeness of the headset for demos, and this would improve from getting the lenses closer, but this was my experience and the lenses are very small compared to others on the market now. (Had to edit this)

The brightness is extremely lacking, pass through feels like you’re wearing sunglasses. 

We’re still far away from “wow I can’t tell I’m wearing a headset” level pass through. They managed to eliminate the wavy outlines that occur in quest pass through when you hold your hand or phone up, but whatever they did to fix this made depth perception difficult. 

3D videos taken on the avp look like they’re recorded in 720p, although the vids taken from iPhone were actually quite impressive. 

The occlusion with your hands being visible in environments is the best I’ve seen, but it’s still far from perfect. Tons of edges peeking through. 

It is wildly uncomfortable, major pressure on my forehead and considering maybe 100,000 people bought one at most, there’s not going to be any 3rd party facial interfaces. 

Now for some good, I’ll give credit where credit is due. 
Resolution is stunning, best I’ve seen, but that’s also with a small field of view so…. PPD is artificially increased by that. 

8k high framerate vr videos look AMAZING, this is the one thing i say they’ve done absolutely incredibly. Movies look good too and you can really see the detail. 

Rendered things such as environments and the Dino demo look STUNNING like… as good or better than pc graphics. 

The windows do stay put and the shadows are cool. 


TLDR; it’s about 50% better than the quest 3 in terms of the overall experience, but 700% more expensive, and without controllers or games, they really shit themselves on this one. Tons of potential, most of it missed. I would not want to use this for anything productive, it’s majorly uncomfortable, and productivity is the only use case I could possibly see with this device. I’d maybe pay $300 for this, not 3500. For the price of a Varjo headset, I expect to be blown away at everything, but it’s just a good bit better than other hmds at certain things, and drastically lacking in other departments.

"and it wasn’t as bad as you’d think.

Comfortability:
Note that I did not take the headset off at all during the 8 hours.
Against the advice of the greater group, I did this experiment with the solo knit band because for me, it’s the best looking and easiest to use.
It wasn’t comfortable but it also wasn’t painful until about 6 hours in. The pain was centered around the back of my head from the pressure of the band (no, I didn’t have it that tight). My face never really felt any pain, just general discomfort. In general, I got used to the discomfort an hour or two in so it was totally manageable.

Software Bugs:
Around hour 7, I started experiencing some serious bugs. Things like apps not responding to input, apps hanging and then crashing, physical buttons not responding, apps not launching, significant lag, and visual bugs (windows flashing and disappearing). I was using VisionOS 1.0.2.

Battery:
I started with 100% battery, ran down to 10%, charged back up to 100%, ran back down to 40%, and then charged back up to 100% before the end of the experiment. So total usage during the 8 hours was 150% (although that does not include energy used while charging, which is why it is so low)

What did I do for eight hours?
I just did my computer desk job as normal through the passthrough cameras. It did take some time to get used to since the cameras are obviously not as crisp as real life, but after a few hours I didn’t have a problem reading off my monitors. Unfortunately, I couldn’t use Teams or any O365 app on the AVP because there’s no way my org is going to allow me to sign in on an unmanaged device.
It was awesome to be able to respond to texts and emails on the AVP without having to move my hand far from my mouse or even pick up my phone.

Taking it off:
Idk what I was expecting when I took it off but it was pretty anti-climatic. I didn’t have the dramatic response to the rapid increase in FOV and clarity that I was expecting. But a couple hours later and I can still feel a phantom pressure on my cheeks from the light seal cushion. Also, my eyes do feel a bit weird now and my depth perception is also the tiniest bit off. 

Conclusion:
Did I gain any significant advantage for doing my job through an AVP? Probably not. Was it cool? Absolutely.",design,"Task:  atsc

I started with 100% battery, ran down to 10%, charged back up to 100%, ran back down to 40%, and then charged back up to 100% before the end of the experiment. So total usage during the 8 hours was 150% (although that does not include energy used while charging, which is why it is so low)

What did I do for eight hours?
I just did my computer desk job as normal through the passthrough cameras. It did take some time to get used to since the cameras are obviously not as crisp as real life, but after a few hours I didn’t have a problem reading off my monitors. Unfortunately, I couldn’t use Teams or any O365 app on the AVP because there’s no way my org is going to allow me to sign in on an unmanaged device.
It was awesome to be able to respond to texts and emails on the AVP without having to move my hand far from my mouse or even pick up my phone.

Taking it off:
Idk what I was expecting when I took it off but it was pretty anti-climatic. I didn’t have the dramatic response to the rapid increase in FOV and clarity that I was expecting. But a couple hours later and I can still feel a phantom pressure on my cheeks from the light seal cushion. Also, my eyes do feel a bit weird now and my depth perception is also the tiniest bit off. 

Conclusion:
Did I gain any significant advantage for doing my job through an AVP? Probably not. Was it cool? Absolutely.",price,"Task:  atsc

Comfortability:
Note that I did not take the headset off at all during the 8 hours.
Against the advice of the greater group, I did this experiment with the solo knit band because for me, it’s the best looking and easiest to use.
It wasn’t comfortable but it also wasn’t painful until about 6 hours in. The pain was centered around the back of my head from the pressure of the band (no, I didn’t have it that tight). My face never really felt any pain, just general discomfort. In general, I got used to the discomfort an hour or two in so it was totally manageable.

"So I’ve been playing around using my Apple Vision Pro as a virtual screen for Traktor at home. 

I recorded a sick four deck stems drum and bass demo to show you guys, but stupidly the AVP didn’t record any audio so you can’t get the full experience. 

I wasn’t going to upload it (especially since the first person POV is kind of nauseating to watch), but u/astromech_dj ‘s latest article on Rogue DJs sparked my interest and u/youngtankred encouraged me to post it anyway. 

While you can’t get much from the video, and I would never buy an AVP just for this purpose, it is absolutely awesome to have a big virtual screen like this right in your face without the need for a big monitor. 

In fact I sold my big display monitor that I often used for work here (laptop sitting on top of the deck saver for the mixer) and use the AVP almost exclusively for a large laptop display now. 

At the price it doesn’t make sense (and work bought it anyway), but as the price comes down I think it will become a more and more viable solution. It’s nothing like VR DJing at all, and right now is basically just a monitor replacement, but you can see how having virtual record boxes, effects and so on will evolve over time.

"New post with why I kept it: https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/s/1xXtxDQc15

TLDR - You are not missing out on much.

Gonna do a quick numbered comparison AVP to Q3 - More thoughts in a later post just wanted to let everyone know they are not missing out on much.

AVP:

10/10 Resolution

10/10 Color

9/10 User experience 

3/10 Weight on face

5/10 FOV 


Q3:

7/10 Resolution

5/10 Color

8/10 User Experience 

9/10 Weight on face

8/10 FOV

Why do I say you are not missing out on much? 

The pixel smear is horrendous. Apple didn’t solve OLED Mura/Pixel smear and it is extremely off putting and disorienting to turn your head just a little to fast. Not even that fast, just a little fast. Like normal head turning speed.

I would wait for Q Pro 2 if you were looking to upgrade. If Apple can’t solve the pixel smear/mura of OLED tech then no one can. The Quantum dot mini-LED LCD tech of Q Pro 1 was the true king. The only disappointing thing about the Q Pro 1 was the resolution - which Q3 improved but it was sadly LCD so colors/dynamic range were a downgrade over Q Pro.

Also, the “180 3D 8k” immersive experiences are more like 160. And half of the scenes are lowered FOV. Prob about 120-130, not much but it takes away from the immersion when you can’t see the ground or sky completely when you look 100% up, down, left, right.

Although the sharpness at that resolution with the AVP panels is jaw dropping, the pixel smear is horrendous.

Also, my eyeballs are already tired from having to physically look at every thing I’m clicking, instead of just using my hands or controllers to point.

Gonna get right to work on mastering my Q2/Q3 immersive 180 3D 8k experiences for AVP. Someone’s gotta put some decent 180 content out there for everyone if Apples gonna drop the ball on it. They should call it Apple 160 3D 8k experiences.

Edit: It’s ridiculously heavy. Nothing like how light Q3 is, so it’s a bit uncomfortable.

FOV is lower than Q2 on Vertical axis and about the same FOV as Q2 on horizontal axis. You read that right it’s lower that Q2 (Q3 is higher FOV for all axis)

Edit 2: The small oval FOV isn’t even fully usable, because if you look close to the edges of the FOV there is distortion and color shift on the last 5-10 degrees. The lenses themselves are distorting it. No edge to edge clarity like Q3.

Edit 3: Holy hell the glare on this is terrible. There is a lot of glare on the lens when using the web. Not something that can be fixed with a software update.",price,"Task:  atsc

Running inference on input:  As an avid VR fan, I think Apple shares a lot of the blame for this. The support from Apple has been abysmal. No new immersive content since release, no support for OpenVR or OpenAR (a glaring omission that robs the headset of metric tons of content) no live sports or concerts (superbowl, march madness, taylor swifts eras tour disney release all came and went without any of the rumored vr integration), no new first party apps, no Netflix or YouTube even two months later, Meta and Sony supported their products far better than this. Hell you still cant even use the headset to watch a movie at night without it constantly stopping the movie to tell you there isnt enough light.

Why did they release a product that they had no intention to support?|price

"""*Apple Inc. began taking preorders for its long-awaited Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Friday, and early indications suggest that buyers are snapping up initial supplies of the $3,499 device.* 
  

  
*The product went on sale at 8 a.m. Eastern time on Apple’s website and mobile app, ahead of its rollout on Feb. 2. Delivery dates for all three models quickly slipped to March 8-15 for online orders, and the device was sold out for in-store pickup on day one at many locations. The delay signals that either demand is strong or supplies are limited — or something in between.*

*Apple shares gained as much as 1.8% to $191.95 Friday in New York, erasing most of its 2% decline for January.* 
  

  
*With the launch, the company disclosed two additional configurations: a version with 512 gigabytes of storage for $3,699, and a top-end model with 1 terabyte of space for $3,899. The base model includes 256 gigabytes of storage. The company also said it would sell a carrying case for $199 and additional batteries for $199, while extra bands will cost $99 a piece.* 
  

  
*The purchasing process for the Vision Pro is unique. Customers need to use a recent iPhone or iPad to scan their head and, if necessary, provide a vision prescription. Apple typically doesn’t comment on the sales performance of new products.*
  
*Wall Street analysts are predicting a slow start for the device. UBS Group AG analyst David Vogt expects Apple to ship 300,000 to 400,000 units this year, generating as much as $1.4 billion. For a company that had sales of $383 billion last year, that’s “immaterial.”*

*Still, the idea is to set the stage for something bigger. Apple is entering its first major new product category since the company began selling smartwatches in 2015, and the Vision Pro may take years to catch on. Apple will continue to refine the headset — making it cheaper and more comfortable — and find compelling applications for the device.*
  

  
*In the longer run, Apple could use a fresh moneymaker. The smartphone market has matured, and it’s under particular pressure in China. The company’s revenue has fallen for four straight quarters — its longest streak of declines in more than two decades.*

*Initially, the Cupertino, California-based company only plans to sell the Vision Pro in the US, with launches in other markets coming in the months ahead. The company is eyeing the UK, Canada and China as some of the first other countries, Bloomberg News has reported.*
  

  
*It’s a complex product to manufacture, which could limit early supplies. The dual 4K resolution displays in the headset, which melds virtual and augmented reality, have suffered production snags. But the fact that Apple has been ramping up manufacturing for months suggests that it will be able to satisfy initial demand. The company is also offering a 25% discount on the device for employees, signaling that supplies aren’t too tight.*

*Inside Apple, executives are anticipating a strong opening weekend, with sales tapering off later. At $3,499, the Vision Pro is one of the priciest consumer headsets ever — about seven times more expensive than the latest device from VR market leader Meta Platforms Inc.*
  

  
*The Vision Pro also will be a hard product to share with family and friends. It requires a precise fitting process to ensure a good experience. The face scan is designed to determine the best light seal and strap size for users. The company has prepared 25 different light seals — a cushion that prevents light from seeping into the wearer’s field of view — in addition to two straps. There also are prescription lens inserts, at an additional cost.* 
  

  
*And the headset may be hard for some people to wear for extended periods. In early testing, some users have found it to be too heavy.*
  

  
*Another concern that’s cropped up in recent days is a lack of support from top streaming apps. Netflix Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Google’s YouTube are opting not to release software for the device, at least at launch.*
  

  
*But Apple has carefully refined its sales pitch for the headset. When consumers try it out at Apple retail stores, they’ll get a 25-minute demo, letting them get comfortable with the 3D experience that the company calls “spatial computing.”*
  

  
*To commemorate the launch, Apple executives Mike Rockwell and Alan Dye discussed the device in a Q&A shared with employees this week.*
  

  
*A key focus, said Dye, was ensuring that the Vision Pro didn’t have a closed-in feel — a complaint with VR headsets.*
  

  
*“From the onset, we all had concerns about people sitting with their eyes covered and disconnected from the world,” he said. “It really became central to how we thought about the core principles of the product.”*
  

  
*That led to the EyeSight system, which can show a wearer’s eyes through a screen on the front of the Vision Pro. “It was a huge technical challenge to do this in a way that looks and feels natural,” Rockwell said.*
  

  
*Apple also developed an interface that doesn’t require handheld accessories. Instead, it tracks eye movement and hand gestures. Users control the device by looking at an on-screen item and pinching their fingers together to select it.*
  

  
*One of the biggest selling points may be how easy it makes collaboration, Rockwell said. Users in far-flung locations can feel like they’re in the same place.*
  

  
*“It’s the closest thing to being there in person that you can possibly have,” Rockwell said. “It changes the way you collaborate and is very different from videoconferencing as we know it.”*

"""*Apple Inc. began taking preorders for its long-awaited Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Friday, and early indications suggest that buyers are snapping up initial supplies of the $3,499 device.* 
  

  
*The product went on sale at 8 a.m. Eastern time on Apple’s website and mobile app, ahead of its rollout on Feb. 2. Delivery dates for all three models quickly slipped to March 8-15 for online orders, and the device was sold out for in-store pickup on day one at many locations. The delay signals that either demand is strong or supplies are limited — or something in between.*

*Apple shares gained as much as 1.8% to $191.95 Friday in New York, erasing most of its 2% decline for January.* 
  

  
*With the launch, the company disclosed two additional configurations: a version with 512 gigabytes of storage for $3,699, and a top-end model with 1 terabyte of space for $3,899. The base model includes 256 gigabytes of storage. The company also said it would sell a carrying case for $199 and additional batteries for $199, while extra bands will cost $99 a piece.* 
  

  
*The purchasing process for the Vision Pro is unique. Customers need to use a recent iPhone or iPad to scan their head and, if necessary, provide a vision prescription. Apple typically doesn’t comment on the sales performance of new products.*
  
*Wall Street analysts are predicting a slow start for the device. UBS Group AG analyst David Vogt expects Apple to ship 300,000 to 400,000 units this year, generating as much as $1.4 billion. For a company that had sales of $383 billion last year, that’s “immaterial.”*

*Still, the idea is to set the stage for something bigger. Apple is entering its first major new product category since the company began selling smartwatches in 2015, and the Vision Pro may take years to catch on. Apple will continue to refine the headset — making it cheaper and more comfortable — and find compelling applications for the device.*
  

  
*In the longer run, Apple could use a fresh moneymaker. The smartphone market has matured, and it’s under particular pressure in China. The company’s revenue has fallen for four straight quarters — its longest streak of declines in more than two decades.*

*Initially, the Cupertino, California-based company only plans to sell the Vision Pro in the US, with launches in other markets coming in the months ahead. The company is eyeing the UK, Canada and China as some of the first other countries, Bloomberg News has reported.*
  

  
*It’s a complex product to manufacture, which could limit early supplies. The dual 4K resolution displays in the headset, which melds virtual and augmented reality, have suffered production snags. But the fact that Apple has been ramping up manufacturing for months suggests that it will be able to satisfy initial demand. The company is also offering a 25% discount on the device for employees, signaling that supplies aren’t too tight.*

*Inside Apple, executives are anticipating a strong opening weekend, with sales tapering off later. At $3,499, the Vision Pro is one of the priciest consumer headsets ever — about seven times more expensive than the latest device from VR market leader Meta Platforms Inc.*
  

  
*The Vision Pro also will be a hard product to share with family and friends. It requires a precise fitting process to ensure a good experience. The face scan is designed to determine the best light seal and strap size for users. The company has prepared 25 different light seals — a cushion that prevents light from seeping into the wearer’s field of view — in addition to two straps. There also are prescription lens inserts, at an additional cost.*

"Got an AVP demo at the Apple store today… and all I can think is thank God I saved my money. 

I’ll start with the bad

Hand tracking has serious latency issues, q3 actually has equivalent or better hand tracking imo. I had quite a few missed taps and moving my hands around with something virtual tracking them showed that there’s at least 60-100ms of latency for hand tracking. 

Eye tracking either has minor latency issues or the responsiveness of highlighting is messed up. Psvr2 has quicker and more accurate eye tracking imo. 

The fov is god awful. I think my original vive had better fov, it can’t be more than 70-80 degrees based on what I experienced. You get used to it pretty quickly but there was major shock having played my q3 immediately before. Undoubtedly they play it safe with the closeness of the headset for demos, and this would improve from getting the lenses closer, but this was my experience and the lenses are very small compared to others on the market now. (Had to edit this)

The brightness is extremely lacking, pass through feels like you’re wearing sunglasses. 

We’re still far away from “wow I can’t tell I’m wearing a headset” level pass through. They managed to eliminate the wavy outlines that occur in quest pass through when you hold your hand or phone up, but whatever they did to fix this made depth perception difficult. 

3D videos taken on the avp look like they’re recorded in 720p, although the vids taken from iPhone were actually quite impressive. 

The occlusion with your hands being visible in environments is the best I’ve seen, but it’s still far from perfect. Tons of edges peeking through. 

It is wildly uncomfortable, major pressure on my forehead and considering maybe 100,000 people bought one at most, there’s not going to be any 3rd party facial interfaces. 

Now for some good, I’ll give credit where credit is due. 
Resolution is stunning, best I’ve seen, but that’s also with a small field of view so…. PPD is artificially increased by that. 

8k high framerate vr videos look AMAZING, this is the one thing i say they’ve done absolutely incredibly. Movies look good too and you can really see the detail. 

Rendered things such as environments and the Dino demo look STUNNING like… as good or better than pc graphics. 

The windows do stay put and the shadows are cool. 


TLDR; it’s about 50% better than the quest 3 in terms of the overall experience, but 700% more expensive, and without controllers or games, they really shit themselves on this one. Tons of potential, most of it missed. I would not want to use this for anything productive, it’s majorly uncomfortable, and productivity is the only use case I could possibly see with this device. I’d maybe pay $300 for this, not 3500. For the price of a Varjo headset, I expect to be blown away at everything, but it’s just a good bit better than other hmds at certain things, and drastically lacking in other departments.

The occlusion with your hands being visible in environments is the best I’ve seen, but it’s still far from perfect. Tons of edges peeking through. 

It is wildly uncomfortable, major pressure on my forehead and considering maybe 100,000 people bought one at most, there’s not going to be any 3rd party facial interfaces. 

Now for some good, I’ll give credit where credit is due. 
Resolution is stunning, best I’ve seen, but that’s also with a small field of view so…. PPD is artificially increased by that. 

8k high framerate vr videos look AMAZING, this is the one thing i say they’ve done absolutely incredibly. Movies look good too and you can really see the detail. 

Rendered things such as environments and the Dino demo look STUNNING like… as good or better than pc graphics. 

The windows do stay put and the shadows are cool. 


TLDR; it’s about 50% better than the quest 3 in terms of the overall experience, but 700% more expensive, and without controllers or games, they really shit themselves on this one. Tons of potential, most of it missed. I would not want to use this for anything productive, it’s majorly uncomfortable, and productivity is the only use case I could possibly see with this device. I’d maybe pay $300 for this, not 3500. For the price of a Varjo headset, I expect to be blown away at everything, but it’s just a good bit better than other hmds at certain things, and drastically lacking in other departments.

I’ll start with the bad

Hand tracking has serious latency issues, q3 actually has equivalent or better hand tracking imo. I had quite a few missed taps and moving my hands around with something virtual tracking them showed that there’s at least 60-100ms of latency for hand tracking. 

Eye tracking either has minor latency issues or the responsiveness of highlighting is messed up. Psvr2 has quicker and more accurate eye tracking imo. 

The fov is god awful. I think my original vive had better fov, it can’t be more than 70-80 degrees based on what I experienced. You get used to it pretty quickly but there was major shock having played my q3 immediately before. Undoubtedly they play it safe with the closeness of the headset for demos, and this would improve from getting the lenses closer, but this was my experience and the lenses are very small compared to others on the market now. (Had to edit this)

The brightness is extremely lacking, pass through feels like you’re wearing sunglasses.

"Okay I’ve been using my Vision Pro for a month and here is what I though about this product overall.


Comfort: this is an issue mentioned by many tech reviewers and non hardcore VR users, “it’s heavy blah blah blah”
This thing is not lightweight compared to Xreal Pro 2 but for us, VR hardcore users who haven been trained by something like Pimax Crystal, Varjo XR4( both are 2 pounds/1kg+ hmds), VP is nothing in fact I can now use it for several hrs seated with solo knit band for web browsing & movie viewing. If you get the right facial gasket, the pressure points can be adjusted to the forehead rather than the cheekbones, which is quire comfortable.


FOV: 21W is doing the magic for me to get close to Quest 3/Pro horizontal FOV and vertical is also not that bad anymore, again this device is not very sensitive to FOV as a mixed reality headset.


Input method: eye tracking+hand gestures is not yet accurate enough to be the only input method, the more I use it, the more I feel like this is just a PSVR2 level eye tracking, for simple game menu it’s fine but for productivity and even just web browsing, a lot times I can’t choose the right tab/words I want even I’m pretty sure I’m staring at what I want to select, Apple, plz improve this with your next gen VP with best eye tracking module you can buy, this PSVR2 level accuracy is a joke for general computing, in fact I feel Quest 3 is easier to use with hand tracking despite many ppl don’t like its UX/UI.


Build quality: 10/10, better than Varjo XR4, those Chinese really know how to make good consumer electronics nowadays. But the solo knit band is certainly not worth $100 each…I was considering getting 2nd one for top strap mod but I think I’m good for now.

Productivity:
No one mentioned but you can still have tiny bit flickering with text sometimes, best headset for productivity but it’s still not perfect compared to traditional 4K monitors.


The Digital Crown with immersive environment is probably the most realistic Virtual experience I’ve ever seen, even better than some 4090 powered PCVR mods including those Unreal Engine tech demo, thx to the fantastic Sony micro OLED panel, I wish PCVR can have access to that one day …",design,"Task:  atsc
