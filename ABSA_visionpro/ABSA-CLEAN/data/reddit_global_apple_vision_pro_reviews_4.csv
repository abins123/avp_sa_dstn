Are you excited for Apple's VR/AR/MR Headset ?,"Those in the VR 'community' are getting excited for the announcement of this headset. We don't know the full extent of it's features or what it can do.

All we know is it is expensive (around 3000 USD) which is 7 times the price of a Quest 2.

Just wondering what the general Apple 'fanboy' (said in a positive way :) ) opinion or excitement level is for this Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality/Mixed Reality headset ?

"Apple Unveils Vision Pro AR/VR Headset, Its First Major New Product In Nearly A Decade","On Monday, Apple unveiled its much-anticipated mixed reality headset, the Vision Pro, the tech giant’s first major new product category since 2015’s Apple Watch.

The new device, packed with cameras and sensors, looks like a futuristic pair of ski goggles, and can immerse a wearer in virtual reality but also blend in the real-world elements of augmented reality. CEO Tim Cook announced the new product at the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference held at its sparkling Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino, CA.

Apple’s virtual reality plans date back roughly a decade, and Cook has been teasing his ambitions publicly for the better part of that time. As far back as 2016, the company filed patents for lightweight eyeglasses and a bulkier device. But while Cook reportedly preferred the more compact option, according to reports by Bloomberg, the technical challenge forced Apple to change its strategy.

The device announcement comes years after other Silicon Valley juggernauts including Meta and Google parent Alphabet have tried to bring high-tech headsets into the mainstream. Facebook in 2014 bought the startup Oculus for $2 billion and has released two generations of its Meta Quest, geared mostly toward gamers. Microsoft in 2016 made a big bet on its Hololens headset, a 3D augmented reality device, but has failed to gain traction with consumers. Google made the buzziest splash more than a decade ago with its disastrous Google Glass, a sleek headset with a camera on board. The product drew immediate outrage, with early adopters dubbed “glassholes.”

Apple has rarely been first to new product categories, instead letting other companies take the lead while it developed products it hoped could dominate over rivals. Apple was beat to market in mp3 players, smartphones, tablets and smartwatches, but its iPods, iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches have all become category-defining devices.

Apple will have a bigger challenge ahead as it asks people to put its latest product directly on their faces for everyday use—an aim which has eluded all its well-capitalized predecessors. Today’s headsets often lead to people complaining about the devices overheating, being too heavy to wear for too long or leaving sweaty foreheads. Others have found the experience of being disconnected to the real world—immersed in full-on virtual reality for long periods of time—too isolating. Cook said in an interview with GQ earlier this year that Apple’s device could increase collaboration, though Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision to achieve a similar effect in the workplace has failed to take off.

Apple VR + AI porn will probably make porn even a more realistic alternative to sex,"Apple VRs, if they take root, will probably revolutionize sex and porn. We know smart phones already fucked up most average men's chances to get women, VR may be an equalizer by replacing flat-screen porn.

So far, porn for men is a pacifier. Just fap and forget about women and sex for a few hours. However, it is not a replacement for real sexual experience because there is no immersion and touch. The good thing is that sexual desire is very primitive, and it can easily be tricked with porn and masturbation, at least to a point, even if it is not a full replacement. VRs will make it even easier to immerse in porn, making it more satisfying.

AI will open a new category of personalized perversions that probably cause lots of controversy but be legal. Porn that would be illegal if real, will be legal if generated by computers. Imagine so many men close to you will be watching all kind of AI generated evil, and you will never know, and it will be fully legal because there are no real victims. Creepy but unavoidable.

Only reason for real sex will probably be to get love and affection or shit like that, but honestly not even most real women today give that to men who are married, and plenty of men are OK with sex alone. In fact, I expect a lot of married men to complete their marriage using VR virtual sex. Men may also put the VRs to enhance the beauty of their wives... it is a win-win, they will feel desired and men will actually fuck what they desire in their heads.

Robots for sexual satisfaction will not need to look realistic if in synch with the VR, so no need to wait for realistic robots. Realism will be VR and robot can be only on sensations.

Apple Vision Pro to BoboVR Rails,"I did not like any of the existing adapters, so I created this. It is super sturdy and allows for forward backward adjustment. You can use it as shown, or replace the back of the BoboVR with the Solo Knit Band. You can use it with or without the light shield.  They easily clip on and off of the Vision Pro, and slide into the BoboVR M2 with a nice friction fit. If anyone has questions or comments, just let me know!

It's super comfy and feels almost weightless.  I have been using this all day for a while and am super happy!  Good luck and enjoy.

EDIT:  Added an adapter to connect the Solo Knit Band to the BoboVR instead of the Apple Vision Pro

"Apple’s first VR headset reportedly includes a fabric design, a fan, and expensive price tag","> Apple is reportedly working on a VR headset that will include a fabric design, a fan, and an expensive price tag. Bloomberg News reports that Apple’s first VR headset may launch as soon as 2022 as a standalone device that operates through batteries, similar to the Oculus Quest 2. Apple is reportedly working on “some of its most advanced and powerful chips” for this unannounced VR headset, with some chips reportedly beating its own M1 Mac processors.

Hot Take: Apples focus on 'every day computing' instead of gaming is good for VR,"Putting aside the price and general lack of content shown around this new headset, it seems clear to me that Apple is positioning this headset as a general purpose monitor replacement rather than a gaming / VR device. Current headsets on the market are great for playing games, no question there, but they suck as a general purpose monitor replacement for a whole mix of reasons. Apple pushing their headset in that direction, moving us away from having to use monitors, is a net good for the overall adoption of VR. VR is currently too niche because it has no ""general utility"" and Apples whole presentation on ""you can watch a movie and look at pictures of your kids"" might seem laughable to us as enthusiasts is actually what the average person needs to see so they can picture how this device actually fits into their lives OTHER than as a gaming ""toy"".",305,141v8bw,virtualreality,https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/141v8bw/hot_take_apples_focus_on_every_day_computing/,234,1686006088.0

The Apple Vision Pro has skewered my entire perspective of VR ,"I have a Quest 3 and so far I have been very happy with my purchase. However, I went to try out the Apple Vision Pro demo and I was blown away. So blown away in fact that how my quest 3 doesn’t feel as good anymore. It’s to a point where I’ve already factory reset it because I’m heavily considering selling it. I want to save up for the theoretical valve index 2 to be released. I don’t believe that vr is currently for me and I want it to get just a little bit better. Has anyone else felt like this?

Can The Apple Effect Make VR Mainstream?,"Anticipation is high for Apple's rumored AR/VR headset.

There are many rumoured specs I won't go into. Instead I believe the success of the headset won't be determined by specs, but by Apple's unique selling points: marketing, user experience, and seamless integration. I weigh them up below.

&#x200B;

**MARKETING EXCELLENCE:**  


* AR/VR technology is currently where smartphones were before the iPhone - promising but struggling to find mainstream acceptance.
* Apple's skill in packaging and marketing emerging technologies could overcome barriers such as the relatively niche appeal of VR.
* The company's historical success in transforming tech products into desirable consumer goods could indicate similar success with their AR/VR headset.

**But is Marketing Enough?**  


* Apple's high price point for the headset could be a deterrent, but the company has a history of successfully selling premium products.
* The headset targets a unique demographic of professionals with high purchasing power, setting the stage for widespread adoption when the tech is ready for the mass market.
* Yet, there are concerns about the device's high cost and the limited market of prosumers, which might hamper Apple's push for mainstream AR/VR adoption.

**SUPERIOR USER EXPERIENCE:**  


* User experience is vital for tech products, and current VR headsets suffer from user experience challenges.
* Apple's expertise in creating seamless, intuitive experiences across its devices could help overcome these challenges.

**Is better UX enough?**  


* Apple could simplify onboarding, reducing complexities and prioritizing user enjoyment.
* However, the scarcity of high-quality AR/VR content and the learning curve associated with AR/VR could present significant challenges to Apple.

**SEAMLESS INTEGRATION:**  


* Apple's strength in creating a harmonious ecosystem of devices and services could provide a seamless VR experience for users. This unified ecosystem not only enhances user experience but also drives customer loyalty, ultimately leading to increased product sales for Apple, both now and in the future.

**Is Integration Enough?**  


* The possibility of the headset integrating with other Apple devices could create an enhanced experience for users.
* However, Apple's preference for a self-contained ecosystem might estrange a ready audience and risk isolation in the AR/VR market.

**FINAL VERDICT:**  


* Apple's venture into AR/VR technology represents a transformative era in human-technology interaction.
* The initial cost of investment into mixed reality might be a step too far for the average consumer. But it is an invitation for devs to explore its potential and populate this new world with compelling experiences before more economical devices. The so-called [Apple Glasses](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-glasses) could be one of those. But a [second Apple headset that's more affordable](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apples-cheaper-vrar-headset-already-in-development-says-new-report) is tipped to arrive first. 
* Apple is readying itself to introduce not just a product, but a seismic shift in our digital reality. A shift they are uniquely positioned to realise.",39,13kumdv,virtualreality,https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/13kumdv/can_the_apple_effect_make_vr_mainstream/,102,1684404821.0

SteamVR Games on Apple Vision Pro,"Here's a few clips of SteamVR games I've playing on the Apple Vision Pro, using ALVR with Index knuckle controllers tracked separately via Lighthouses. I already owned these devices so setting it up was a no brainer. It does take some effort to initially configure, and there's a ton of settings once it is setup. I wouldn't suggest running out to buy the lighthouses, steamVR dongles, and controllers as it's still under development. All in all, it's not too shabby though considering the AVP has only been out a little over a month.

"Anyone considering the Apple VR Headset, particularly for work?","I know this is expensive, and I know the fact that I can consider it is a privilege. But I already was about to buy a new laptop after four years, and part of me wonders if this thing could extend my reasonable, pain reduced working life. It's theoretically a laptop replacement, not in addition to.

Anyone look into this? Any reviewers you've heard of with disabilities? 

Apparently it works without an additional computer, so it would be the entirety of the cost. The ideal of lounging entirely in my recliner and typing against my thighs, or up and about, or any position want, is actually making me consider this. But first gen things are almost never a good idea! And then there's the neck issue, is this too heavy and going to cause neck pain.

The M1 Pro / Max early benchmarks and performance per watt make me incredibly excited to see an Apple VR/AR headset,"Just thinking about the amount of power they've been able to squeeze into these new chips with low power consumption, plus the headset rumors that we've seen about 8k display for both eyes, and a bunch of HD cameras on the outside for AR makes me think that the device alone is probably going to be pretty amazing (if it ever comes out). 

Then add to that this rumor / leak that the device is also going to be optimized wireless streaming of processing:

https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data

I'm now really damn curious to see what will be able to be done with these. 

Obviously games are going to be a big draw, but considering that both the iPhone and new MacBooks are on the same architecture, I'm wondering if you'll be able to stream processing to and from an ARM MacBook. I really want to be able to do the work I would normally do on my laptop, but on the VR/AR device with essentially a 360 degree screen around me so that I can position windows and apps wherever I want, but also still be aware of what is around me in the real world.

Is it just Apple that does not want to focus on VR games? As most of the ""Apple vision pro"" AND ""gaming"" ends up being something like Fortnite played in 2d, on a 3d device?

Apple sold me a Quest 3 - My VR/XR journey so far,"So, I'm a tech enthusiast, but not a developer or employed in tech at all. I've been all in on the Apple ecosystem since 2009. I only use Windows for work on a company-provided laptop and my son had a gaming PC. We do have an Xbox Series X as well (Forza Horizon is my guilty pleasure). But our family is all-in on Mac and iOS, with more devices than I can count across the house. All this to say I am no disinterested observer when it comes to Apple.

However, VR/XR is something I have not really explored, but it's always fascinated me. I always found it too clunky and tethered to a PC or limited in some other way. When the Apple Vision Pro was announced it looked like the future had arrived, and I recalled the feeling of awe that the first iPhone gave me in 2007.  I was able to schedule the demo of the AVP at my local Apple Store. It was incredible, mind blowing. Loved it. 

So I went home and started doing research about this category and familiarized myself with the state of the marketplace. Then I read about the Meta C-Level exec who said the Meta Quest was better, which made me LOL. Like, of course you would say that. But then I did more digging into the Meta Quest 3 capabilities and the Meta VR ecosystem. And I realized that for 1/7 the price of the AVP I could get into a Quest 3, and have 80-90% of the functionality I care about now (experiences, entertainment, NOT productivity). The Meta Quest 3 ticks so many boxes; wireless capability (with PCVR as an option), color pass-through, hand tracking, spatial video replay, growing gaming library, etc. With the Quest 3 I could make room in my life for a VR/XR device at a price that would only get me yelled at, not divorced!

Result: I bought a Quest 3 and haven't looked back. I have been feeling like I stepped into a future that I've been dreaming about since I was a kid. The experiences, the community in VR, the games and adventure - it's all there now and will only get better.

Is the AVP better in ways? Certainly. Is it SEVEN times better? No, not for me and my use cases. I'm sure someday in the future I will add an Apple XR headset to my family of devices. But Meta has earned my business. I would be very surprised if the AVP didn't sell a bunch of units for Meta, just like in my case. Awareness of the category is something Apple will bring to the mainstream public, and competition is a great thing. As consumers of this technology we all benefit.",134,1bcf1or,OculusQuest,https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1bcf1or/apple_sold_me_a_quest_3_my_vrxr_journey_so_far/,51,1710192731.0

Several games are being teased for Apples upcoming VR/AR headset,"Apple is holding an event June 5th called WWDC where they usually reveal the upcoming software updates and sometimes...hardware...one of the heavy rumours that have been going on for a few years is that Apple has an upcoming VR/AR Headset coming out soon and it would be finally revealed at the WWDC event.

&#x200B;

For example: [Hello Games](https://twitter.com/hellogames/status/1663230974644174873) and [Sean Murray](https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1663169325287501824) (developers of No Mans Sky) both tweeted out an Apple Emoji

An AR/VR focused outlet [UploadVR](https://twitter.com/UploadVR/status/1661069786644660248) also tweeted out that they have been invited to WWDC and that this is their first time getting invited to an Apple Event

[Jaroslav Beck from Beat Saber](https://twitter.com/JaroslavBeck/status/1663468196655931397) also tweeted out ""June 5th is going to be🍿🕶️"" which is when the event will take place

and of course Apples own key art/invites for [WWDC](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/images/live-action/wwdc-2023/Apple-WWDC23-hero_big.jpg.large.jpg) clearly show the rainbow from Apple Park but in a (correct me if im wrong on the type of lens) Pancake Lens array form which is commonly used in VR/AR headsets!

Let me know if there are any more leads that I can add on here!

Edit 1: thanks to u/owl_theory for reminding me but [Hideo Kojima](https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1659338589921234945?t=2P5QQZ5J7Ur4BAhr9SQ6mg&s=19) has also been spotted at Apple Park a few weeks ago, we might just see our first strand type game IN VR/AR, but that could also mean nothing since Kojima gets nauseated from VR games quote:

>“I tried playing, but I got drunk. Actually, I once tried to make an innovative game in VR, but that project was also suspended. But I think there is technical potential for VR. Technology has evolved more and more, and there are more things that can be done, not limited to VR, so I think we can make more various games in the future.”

When Tim Cook was in Japan a few weeks/months ago, he did visit Kojimas studio.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: No Mans Sky has also been announced at last years WWDC but for the Mac, it has not released yet.

"Apple AR/VR headset to be announced in the spring, before WWDC","In the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that Apple intends to announce its long-awaited AR/VR headset product in the spring, before WWDC in June. The device would go on sale later in the fall of 2023, matching analyst Ming-Chi Kuo’s timeline.

Gurman says prototype hardware has already been seeded to a small number of developers for testing. However, he says the device is far from finished and Apple still has to work out several ‘kinks’ in the hardware and software.

Apple VR and Gaming,"The only two use cases for the new headset to me would be 1) flight sims/racing sims 2) making my eyes into laser eyes for the outwards facing display lol. I'm curious to see if this device could be usable with windows pc but highly doubt it given even third party external apple displays like the LG ultrafine's incompatibilities with windows pcs in some areas. It would probably be a great headset for DCS world and MSFS if it was compatible with windows pc's.

But seriously this doesnt seem to have any use cases outside of gaming to me at least (which while M2 chips could potentially be awesome for gaming we've really yet to see any native ports). The fact that they have Hideo Kojima porting death stranding makes me think they might actually be making a gaming play beyond just mobile shit (why that stupid game though wrong type of simulation for it lol).

I could see it being useful for architects etc and some weird specific industrial simulations etc. But as a device used by rich suburb dwellers which is what apple seems to be pitching this device towards with all the facetime videos etc this seems like its a no go until they drive costs down and applications emerge. Another use case that I've heard speculation is as a mobile theater or even productivity suite of displays. People spend 3500$ on that stupid samsung gaming theater and that is not portable and doesnt have a shit ton of sensors and the same level of compute performance in it but you also dont have to wear it lol.

Why Apple's Foray into Spatial Computing Spells Good News for the Entire AR/VR/XR Industry,"With Apple stepping into the spatial computing arena, there's a buzz about how this move will impact the broader AR/VR/XR landscape. Even though Apple brands its tech differently, I believe their entrance is a boon for the entire industry. Let's talk about why Apple's involvement is a game-changer, similar to how the iPhone revolutionized smartphones, paving the way for Android's success.

First off, let's consider the ""Apple effect."" When Apple enters a market, they bring with them a unique ability to popularize and legitimize technology in the eyes of the general public. This isn't just about brand power; it's about how Apple tends to refine and streamline tech into a more accessible and user-friendly package. Their entry into spatial computing will likely elevate public awareness and acceptance of AR/VR/XR technologies as a whole.

It’s important to recognize that Apple's approach to branding and terminology doesn't diminish the overall impact they can have on the industry. For instance, Apple may not directly use the terms AR/VR/XR or even 'headset,' but that doesn’t mean consumers won't naturally group these technologies together. After all, people still universally refer to tweets as tweets, regardless of whatever Elon Musk decides to call them.

Now, let's talk about the Vision Pro and its potential consumers. While the Vision Pro might be the ideal (Apple hopes) for many, its price point or the commitment it requires will be a barrier for many. Here's where Apple's involvement could play a crucial role. Those intrigued by Apple's offering but hesitant to invest in a Vision Pro might turn to more affordable alternatives like the Quest or PCVR systems. These platforms, while different, still offer robust productivity and entertainment experiences. They serve as a gateway, letting users dip their toes into the world of VR/AR without breaking the bank.

Not to mention the limited launch units of Apple's device – rumored to be around 80,000 – and how this scarcity might trigger a surge in demand that spills over to other platforms like the Quest and PCVR. Just 80,000 units at launch is almost a guarantee for overwhelming demand. Many consumers, eager to explore spatial computing but unable to get their hands on Apple's new device, will likely turn to more readily available alternatives.

Another key aspect is the potential for cross-platform development. Developers who initially create apps for Apple's spatial computing devices (regardless of Apple's branding preferences) will likely be encouraged to port these apps over to other platforms. This means a broader, richer ecosystem of apps and experiences for everyone, irrespective of the device they own.

This rising tide of interest could mean more investment in content creation, hardware development, and overall innovation within the space. Existing VR/AR platforms might see increased user bases, and developers could be encouraged to create more diverse and engaging content, knowing there's a growing market.

**TLDR**; Apple's venture into spatial computing isn't just good news for Apple fans; it's a positive development for anyone invested in the AR/VR/XR world. It could catalyze growth, drive innovation, and bring virtual reality technologies into the mainstream - much like what the iPhone did for smartphones.

Dark Matter Apple TV+ Show VR Game?,"Hi all, so I was just thinking, after completing the season finale of the new Apple TV show Dark Matter—which is based on a novel by Blake Crouch— that it would make a damn good VR game or experience. 

Has anyone seen that show?  It’s about multiverses and the infinite possibilities of the universe. By entering into a giant box, think Schrödinger‘s cat, a multitude of universes and variations of your life become available to you whereby many different variations of your current world exist behind an infinite number of doors. 

Some of the doors are very dangerous, with worlds that could scorch you from a sun that’s gone supernova, or ones where everything is turning to dust, or ones that are completely submerged underwater and drowned. Some of these doors can led to death. 

But some of the doors can lead to wondrous worlds beyond your imagination, futuristic, harmonious, beautiful. And some are just like your own world, maybe just slightly different, to the point that the changes are almost imperceptible. 

I think there’s a lot of potential for things that explore wondrous worlds and opportunities in virtual and mixed reality. Do you think this could translate to a good game?",3,1dpgsky,OculusQuest,https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1dpgsky/dark_matter_apple_tv_show_vr_game/,3,1719456301.0

The Impact of the Apple Vision Pro on VR in general: 4-Month Review,"I wanted to start a discussion about the impact of the Apple Vision Pro on the VR industry now that it’s been out for 4 months. Personally, it seems like the interest in this headset is fading hard.

The high price of the Apple Vision Pro has solidified the perception that VR is an expensive, inaccessible technology for most people. If even Apple, with its powerful marketing and brand appeal, couldn’t make this a massive success, it sends a negative message. Many might conclude that the technology itself isn’t ready or is simply not good enough. If even Apple couldn’t succeed, it might deter other major players from making significant investments in the sector.

Additionally, it seems like the initial hype around the Apple Vision Pro has quickly died down. This makes it seem like VR is just a fleeting trend, further damaging its reputation.

In the end, I think the Apple Vision Pro might have done more harm than good for the perception of VR. Instead of democratizing the technology or sparking massive interest, it reinforced negative views and failed to capture long-term public attention.

What do you think? Do you feel the same way? What do you think is the impact of the headset on the general public's perception of VR?",9,1d1lyfw,virtualreality,https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1d1lyfw/the_impact_of_the_apple_vision_pro_on_vr_in/,38,1716794511.0

We haven't seen any leaked pictures of the chassis or any part really, even just a few days before the announcement. With iPhones or other products we have leaked cad models and pictures of the parts months ahead.

Honestly they all just look like someone who doesn't know anything about vr would think an apple vr headset would look like. Some renders have really weird looking lenses or just have one long screen. I just find it weird that the design hasn't changed from that one sketch from 4 years ago.

"If there is a big future in AR/VR, Apple will set the standards.","Finally got my hands on the AVP on Friday (UK). I’ve been looking forward to this for YEARS - and remember even trying the the Google Cardbox with my phone! Then I had the PSVR 1 and 2 and have tried the Quest.

But I have to say, when Apple use the word ‘magical’ - they MEAN it. I fail to understand the hate around this device. Sure the price is high, but boy is it worth it. Whilst the passthrough is grainy sure, you just don’t notice it when the AVP screens pop up. It is CLEAR as day and the pixel density is absolutely insane. Other headsets have a ‘screendoor’ effect, but I cannot see it at all on AVP. It actually is like having a 100 inch OLED screen in front of you - with NO jittering. It truly is ‘spatial computing’.

The eye and hand tracking, whilst it has some issues, is remarkable. The Apple immersive content is the best I’ve seen. The whole thing is so minority report.

I have to say it IS heavy. And I get the odd headache from the pressure of it. Hoping I can try different seals from a booked demo later this week, or I may get the Annapro.

The whole thing is just a peak in to the future, and as expected, Apple have taken an existing technology, given their touch and just made it the best headset out there right now. For me, it’s worth the price. Even if Apple are charging big bucks for what many say is a ‘beta’, I cannot wait to see what they do with this in the future. And that future, evident from this device, belongs to Apple.",28,1e3pxsa,VisionPro,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1e3pxsa/if_there_is_a_big_future_in_arvr_apple_will_set/,18,1721033220.0

>Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off Monday, and expectations are high that the focus of the company’s keynote will be a widely anticipated and speculated about AR/VR headset.  
>  
>Near-term sales expectations for the device—which Apple (ticker: AAPL) has said nothing about—are modest. But there’s an argument that such a product could turn into a substantial business for Apple over the long run.  
>  
>Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring made that case in a research note Friday, in which he reiterated his Overweight rating and lifted his price target on Apple shares to $190 from $185, entirely based on future augmented reality- and virtual reality-related revenue. Shares were trading around $180.58 in midday trading Friday.  
>  
>Apple has materially outperformed the broader market only once on the day of the WWDC over the past decade, Woodring noted, but he said he thinks this year could be an exception because of the opportunity in AR and VR.  
>  
>While Apple hasn’t announced the device, many reports by various media outlets have surfaced with details. As a matter of policy, Apple doesn’t comment on unannounced products.  
>  
>According to media reports, the AR/VR device will be priced at $3,000. Woodring said his checks with Apple’s supply-chain partners suggest it will arrive in the December 2023 quarter, with an initial production of 300,000 to 500,000 units, implying no revenue contribution in the September 2023 fiscal year. He said he thinks shipments will grow slowly, with 850,000 units in fiscal 2024 and 3.4 million by fiscal year 2026.  
>  
>He estimated that revenue from a new device will rise from $2.6 billion in the September 2024 fiscal year to $8 billion in 2026. After that, Woodring said the number could get bigger—maybe a lot bigger.  
>  
>The combination of technological improvements, new use cases, and lower price points will boost the total addressable market to $100 billion in 2030, and over $500 billion by 2037, Woodring said.  
>  
>The analyst concluded that AR/VR could become the next major computing platform for Apple, with revenue topping $20 billion a year by 2030 and perhaps reaching as high as $70 billion. His higher target price for the stock reflects an extra $174 billion in market capitalization for new business, mostly AR and VR devices.  
>  
>That’s a huge leap of faith. As the analyst noted, the market for AR/VR headsets was 9 million units in 2022, down 20% from the previous year. That implies a total market of $4 billion, with most of that going to Meta’s Quest headsets, he said. Apple could provide a catalyst to accelerate growth, he added.  
>  
>A key question for Woodring is what applications will drive buyers. That’s why Apple is launching the device at the developers conference, Woodring said, “to showcase the technological capabilities of the device.”  
>  
>Gaming is an obvious use case, but Woodring also expects to see “fully immersive” videoconferencing, streaming video, fitness apps, and e-reading. To entice early adopters, Apple will to have to highlight entirely new mixed-reality applications, Woodring said.
