Blown Away by The Apple Vision Pro,"I’ve had the Quest 3 for about 6 months. I picked up an Apple Vision Pro 10 days ago with the idea of trying it but then returning it in 14 days. My main use is for media and social media consumption.

Comparing it to the Quest 3 quality wise, I see the quest 3 as version 1 and AVP as version 5. It is that much better. The movie and tv series experience is better than movie theatre quality. Since I’ve been using the AVP I no longer want to use my top of the line OLED and soundbar system.

Now I’m debating keeping it. The cost of a really good tv and soundbar is about $3500+. Same price and better experience plus you can do lots of other things with it.

Apple knocked this one out of the park.

Edit: I shamefully forgot to mention sports watching. Another next level experience. ",229,1b6fbn1,AppleVisionPro,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleVisionPro/comments/1b6fbn1/blown_away_by_the_apple_vision_pro/,138,1709570010.0

Apple Reportedly Suspends Work on Vision Pro 2,,2213,1dittcu,apple,https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/apple-suspends-work-on-vision-pro-2/,681,1718725446.0
Over 60 Days with Apple Vision Pro - Reflections and Experience - No more hate,"I've been using headsets for over 7 years now. I've practically tried out every Virtual Reality headset out there (except for some professional ones): HDK OSVR 1.4, PIMAX 4K, PIMAX 8k, PIMAX 8KX, PIMAX 5K Super, PIMAX Crystal, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Vive Pro, Vive Cosmos, Vive Pro 2, Vive XR Elite, Valve Index, Rift S, Quest 1, Quest 2, Quest Pro, Magic Leap, nReal, DPVR E4, and currently Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro.

I don't think I could even count the hundreds of hours I've spent using all this technology. I'm involved in XR outreach, and well, I've had quite a privileged position in all of this. Additionally, many of you might know me as a member of Infinity One and as one of the creators of Air Cover.

For me, the Apple Vision Pro is the most impressive Extended Reality headset I've ever tested, both in terms of technology and user experience. It hasn't revolutionized anything, but it has stirred up the market with a different vision than we've had in recent years.

The Apple Vision Pro has the best screens I've seen, the best sound, the best passthrough, the best gesture recognition, and the best interface I've encountered in a device of this kind. It's intuitive, easy to handle, although there are times when I'd like to smash it against the ground when the eye tracking doesn't work as it should. Then I remember its cost, and that thought slips away.

When Tim presented it, I saw it clearly: they provide the Hardware, and it's the ""obligation"" of developers to create content to make this gadget usable. And I think this is the main problem many people are having: usability.

Apple marketed it as a space computing system where you can work with spatial multitasking windows and connect it to our Macs (or PC with moonlight, Immersed, etc), as well as a device to view flat and immersive multimedia content. Unfortunately, the media hype surrounding it led many people to be interested in it, especially because they were goofing around in their TikTok and YouTube videos.

[Air Cover + Nylon Strap + Monster Mod BOBOVR 😂](https://preview.redd.it/4tv8v1s0hzzc1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ee16c2a43d84a847ea2a925642ae340192b1fe8)

Luckily, I'm a restless person and I give a lot of usability to the Apple Vision Pro, not only to start designing contraptions to improve ergonomics like this one I'm showing you with a sliding system to place the battery on the back using part of a BOBOVR Strap from the Quest 2 (It was just an experiment, and I had to withdraw it because of the excessive weight it entailed using it like that.), but also for what I'm about to tell you:

* It allows me to use my virtual PC screen (moonlight) to work with it.
* I have multitasking systems with Telegram, Discord, Mail while the main focus is on the Moonlight screen.
* It allows me to connect to SteamVR (PC) via ALVR. Yesterday, I spent about 4 hours in VRChat with the Apple Vision Pro and without controllers (using hand tracking to move).
* It allows me to watch multimedia content alone or with company.
* It allows me to meet with part of the Apple Vision Pro community with Spatial Persona and chat with them.
* It allows me to show my designs to friends or family via Facetime.
* It allows me to browse these forums and stay up-to-date on news of all kinds.
* It allows me to control all 3D printers with their iPad applications.
* It allows me to play Arcade games by connecting the PS5 controller.
* It allows me to watch spatial videos of my son or my pets (I have an iPhone 15 Pro).
* It allows me to write scripts (I have a foldable Bluetooth keyboard) with a touchpad, and by activating Assistive Touch, I can use it as a mouse.

In short, it allows me to use it for everything I want and more. Still, the product is not perfect:

* The weight distribution is terrible. Apple needs to work a lot on this. We designed the Air Cover and the Nylon Strap to achieve the most bearable balance possible.
* It doesn't have virtual controllers, which would have been great for immersive gaming (although I have a feeling Apple doesn't want this type of content).
* We lack more specific content for a particular use, taking advantage of the benefits of Mixed Reality or Spatial Computing. The famous ""killer app"".
* Its price is a significant barrier for consumers, but not for developers or businesses that truly want to harness the potential of this device. The average person will only be able to buy it if they have that money and will truly make use of it.

We are at the birth of this device, a product that due to its high price and the amount of integrated technology is more than evident that it is a development product, so that all developers can use it and create unique experiences. Still, it's a product that can reach consumers, for people who can really afford it and want to use it, but without a doubt, it's a great product.

I understand the frustration of many people who have spent more than $3500 and end up returning it or leaving it in a drawer because they don't know how to use it, but personally, I am very happy with the purchase and extremely proud to own Apple Vision Pro.

What must be clear is that if you're one of those people who enjoys using Apple Vision Pro, keep doing so. Don't let yourself feel down if you go to any place and are bombarded with negative information. Generally, dissatisfied people complain, while those who enjoy something don't go to a forum to talk about it 😉

Apple Vision Pro demand falls 'sharply beyond expectations'. Apple reviewing and adjusting product roadmap and strategy.,"* Apple has cut its 2024 Vision Pro shipments to 400–450k units (vs. market consensus of 700–800k units or more). 
* Apple cut orders before launching Vision Pro in non-US markets, which means that demand in the US market has fallen sharply beyond expectations, making Apple take a conservative view of demand in non-US markets.
* Apple is reviewing and adjusting its head-mounted display (HMD) product roadmap, so there may be no new Vision Pro model in 2025 (the previous expectation was that there would be a new model in 2H25/4Q25). Apple now expects Vision Pro shipments to decline YoY in 2025.

Unity drama will probably kill the Apple Vision Pro,"[Apple partnered with Unity](https://blog.unity.com/engine-platform/unity-support-for-visionos) to create Polyspacial, a system for developing on the Apple Vision Pro. The problem is, pretty much [all devs have been outraged by the new fee structure](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/sep/12/unity-engine-fees-backlash-response) (charging 20 cents for every download) and many have declared an intention to leave Unity for other platforms and even delete their games altogether. 

The main alternative is the Unreal Engine by Epic Games. Epic Games had [a huge lawsuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games_v._Apple#Decision) with Apple because Epic didn't like the Apple tax on their App Store revenue. 

So Apple Vision Pro will have basically no devs for their platform just as they need them to create apps to make this hunk of overpriced glass and aluminium worth buying.

ANNAPRO's Second-gen Comfort Head Strap Design for Apple Vision Pro - We Need Your Feedback!,"Hey folks!

It's been three months since we rolled out our [first-gen Comfort Head Strap for the Apple Vision Pro](https://annapro.com/products/comfort-support-strap-for-apple-vision-pro?from=reddit_gen2_feedback_post), and we've been stoked by the positive feedback! Many of you have proven that it really helps ease the pressure on the face. But we also heard from some of you with larger heads that the strap was a bit snug. So, we've gone back to the drawing board and come up with a new design, and we’d love to get your thoughts!

Here are the key updates:

**1. Better Adjustability:**

For those with larger heads, we've added an adjustable panel with a foam pad. This panel uses a ""ball-and-socket"" mechanism, allowing forward and backward adjustments while staying stable. We also slimmed down the sides to allow about 0.5 cm of front-to-back movement, which helps with eye-tracking adjustments.

**2. Height Upgrade:**

We've increased the strap's overall height for a more comfortable fit. This prevents the AVP from sitting too high and lets users switch to thicker cushions for extra comfort.

**3. Improved Materials:**

We’re planning to switch from the original leather to ice silk material for the foam cushions. The leather could get a bit sweaty, so the ice silk should be way more comfortable, especially in the summer.

**4. Integrated Battery:**

We’ve built the battery into the head strap to balance the weight better and reduce the risk of dropping the main unit. The battery is magnetically detachable and can be swapped out easily, so no more lugging around a huge power bank.

**5. Gear Adjustment:**

Similar to the Meta Quest head strap design, our new strap can be adjusted and tightened with gears, making it easier to get the perfect fit.

These are our ideas for the next-gen Vision Pro head strap, and we can’t wait to hear what you think. Your feedback is super important to us and helps us make our products better.

Thanks in advance for your input!

Cheers,

The ANNAPRO Team

The Apple Vision Pro is too Expensive. And yet…,"When people ask me about the price, I’ll remind them what 61,000 people are paying for a few hours of entertainment in a stadium (not including flight, hotel, food, etc. )

"Currently, what's the point of the Apple Vision Pro?","Apparently it's not for gaming. That leaves its biggest use scenarios to be either the consumption of media, or productivity. 

Productivity wise, there's only so long you can take with a heavy headset strapped to your face. Even if you work from home, you certainly won't be spending all day walking around the house with it like its a pair of Raybans because while it is lighter than the quest 3, it's still about a pound of weight on your face. Not to mention you'd be wired to an external battery, which would probably be kind of annoying. You can't be using it outdoors much either because, looking goofy aside, just like the quest 3, it's pancake lenses are vulnerable to damage from sunlight.

That leaves the vision pro to be used as some sort of personal cinema or portable huge screen, for which it's M2 chip is completely overkill for. 
The problem is that it uses the same pancake lenses as the quest 3. The same lenses that many say have too much glare/ghosting when there's a bright scene in a darker background. More info about the nature of pancake lenses here: https://pimax.com/aspheric-vs-pancake-vr-lenses-and-why-glass/

Personally, I don't even enjoy my quest 3 when it comes to watching media for that reason. Pancake lens glare is inevitable and looks like this, even on the $1000 Bigscreen Beyond: https://youtu.be/pQzSb_JPH5Y?si=tMsJR1I1shrjo3Xt&t=1157

It doesn't matter that the resolution is 2.5 times of the quest 3 if you're going to be getting the same distracting amount of glare and ghosting on anything that looks bright. Consuming media on a $3500 85inch qled 4k tv would be more enjoyable since the image would be absolutely crystal clear, and there's nothing weighing on your face so it's way more comfortable for long viewing sessions. Either way you'll probably be using it at home so the form factor isn't so much the issue. 

So really, what is appeal of the $3500 vision pro? If they sold a Quest 3 that's as light as sunglasses you can wear around all day, with crystal clear optics and a huge immersive FOV, I might say it's worth the price of seven quest 3s. But right now, what's the point of it? 

Sure it has an m2 chip that's Macbook standard, but how is someone going to take full advantage of that with all the other constraints?

Apple Vision Pro as virtual display for Traktor,"So I’ve been playing around using my Apple Vision Pro as a virtual screen for Traktor at home. 

I recorded a sick four deck stems drum and bass demo to show you guys, but stupidly the AVP didn’t record any audio so you can’t get the full experience. 

I wasn’t going to upload it (especially since the first person POV is kind of nauseating to watch), but u/astromech_dj ‘s latest article on Rogue DJs sparked my interest and u/youngtankred encouraged me to post it anyway. 

While you can’t get much from the video, and I would never buy an AVP just for this purpose, it is absolutely awesome to have a big virtual screen like this right in your face without the need for a big monitor. 

In fact I sold my big display monitor that I often used for work here (laptop sitting on top of the deck saver for the mixer) and use the AVP almost exclusively for a large laptop display now. 

At the price it doesn’t make sense (and work bought it anyway), but as the price comes down I think it will become a more and more viable solution. It’s nothing like VR DJing at all, and right now is basically just a monitor replacement, but you can see how having virtual record boxes, effects and so on will evolve over time. 

Anyway, hard to get much from this video but just posted here for the curious!",219,1d7vzvn,DJs,https://v.redd.it/y2i4t8n6uj4d1,129,1717504343.0

Apple Vision Pro Initial Thoughts - From a Quest 3 User,"New post with why I kept it: https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/s/1xXtxDQc15

TLDR - You are not missing out on much.

Gonna do a quick numbered comparison AVP to Q3 - More thoughts in a later post just wanted to let everyone know they are not missing out on much.

AVP:

10/10 Resolution

10/10 Color

9/10 User experience 

3/10 Weight on face

5/10 FOV 


Q3:

7/10 Resolution

5/10 Color

8/10 User Experience 

9/10 Weight on face

8/10 FOV

Why do I say you are not missing out on much? 

The pixel smear is horrendous. Apple didn’t solve OLED Mura/Pixel smear and it is extremely off putting and disorienting to turn your head just a little to fast. Not even that fast, just a little fast. Like normal head turning speed.

I would wait for Q Pro 2 if you were looking to upgrade. If Apple can’t solve the pixel smear/mura of OLED tech then no one can. The Quantum dot mini-LED LCD tech of Q Pro 1 was the true king. The only disappointing thing about the Q Pro 1 was the resolution - which Q3 improved but it was sadly LCD so colors/dynamic range were a downgrade over Q Pro.

Also, the “180 3D 8k” immersive experiences are more like 160. And half of the scenes are lowered FOV. Prob about 120-130, not much but it takes away from the immersion when you can’t see the ground or sky completely when you look 100% up, down, left, right.

Although the sharpness at that resolution with the AVP panels is jaw dropping, the pixel smear is horrendous.

Also, my eyeballs are already tired from having to physically look at every thing I’m clicking, instead of just using my hands or controllers to point.

Gonna get right to work on mastering my Q2/Q3 immersive 180 3D 8k experiences for AVP. Someone’s gotta put some decent 180 content out there for everyone if Apples gonna drop the ball on it. They should call it Apple 160 3D 8k experiences.

Edit: It’s ridiculously heavy. Nothing like how light Q3 is, so it’s a bit uncomfortable.

FOV is lower than Q2 on Vertical axis and about the same FOV as Q2 on horizontal axis. You read that right it’s lower that Q2 (Q3 is higher FOV for all axis)

Edit 2: The small oval FOV isn’t even fully usable, because if you look close to the edges of the FOV there is distortion and color shift on the last 5-10 degrees. The lenses themselves are distorting it. No edge to edge clarity like Q3.

Edit 3: Holy hell the glare on this is terrible. There is a lot of glare on the lens when using the web. Not something that can be fixed with a software update.",376,1ahcowf,OculusQuest,https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1ahcowf/apple_vision_pro_initial_thoughts_from_a_quest_3/,274,1706903987.0
Apple Vision Pro Customer Interest Dying Down at Some Retail Stores,"As an avid VR fan, I think Apple shares a lot of the blame for this. The support from Apple has been abysmal. No new immersive content since release, no support for OpenVR or OpenAR (a glaring omission that robs the headset of metric tons of content) no live sports or concerts (superbowl, march madness, taylor swifts eras tour disney release all came and went without any of the rumored vr integration), no new first party apps, no Netflix or YouTube even two months later, Meta and Sony supported their products far better than this. Hell you still cant even use the headset to watch a movie at night without it constantly stopping the movie to tell you there isnt enough light.

I don’t understand the hate for the Apple Vision Pro.,"Yes, it’s expensive. Is it worth the price in its current state? Probably not. Are other ultra high end headsets worth it? No, also probably not. How I see it, it’s a preview of future technology. The advances and software made by and for the Vision Pro will trickle down to the whole VR industry. The publicity it generates helps VR as a whole. People wearing it in public just help to aliviate the social stigma around vr. Flaws and price aside, it is genuinely interesting technology, and it seems cool, even if it isn’t perfect in its current state.

Apple Vision Pro,"Apple isn't usually the first to bring new technology to the market. They prefer to wait until existing technology has matured a bit before they significantly improve upon it. It seems they've done this again, this time with mixed reality. As with past Apple products, I expect the second or third generation of Apple Vision (Pro) to really take off, for corporate IT support/admin to hate it, and the public to  embrace it. Then other tech companies will try to catch up and it will eventually become standard.

Walked into an Apple store to exchange my light seal….. walked out with a brand new Apple Vision Pro,"TL;DR - Wanted to exchange my light seal, they said they could only exchange the whole device, so i got a brand new AVP.

For context, this Apple store is in a relatively wealthy area, also I was 5 days past my 14 day return window. I walked in last Friday to exchange my 25W light seal for a 21W, that was a circus (see my last post). Anyway they were out of stock so they told me to keep checking online over the next few days for their inventory to refresh. I saw today that they were back in stock, so I go in for an exchange. I tell the employee the whole story about how I came in last Friday and how i’m technically outside of my return window but they said I would be able to exchange my light seal anyway. He hears me out, then he asks for the serial number, clicks around on his device for a bit, then tells me “Okay, hold on for just a sec”, and goes and talks to a couple other employees. Then he comes back and the conversation went like this:

Apple employee - “Alright so we don’t actually have a way in our system to *only* exchange your light seal, so we’re going to have to do a like-for-like exchange of the entire device.” 

Me - “… what?”

Them - “Yep”

Me - “So you’re gonna take my used device and give me… a different used one?” 

Them - “Nope, brand new device, with the 21W light seal.”

Me (kinda chuckling) - “… what?? are you sure?”

Them - “Yep there’s no other way in our system to exchange the light seal”

Me - “…. *really???* a brand new one?”

Them - “Yes sir, we’ll have you sign out of Find My and reset the device while they get the new one ready to bring out”

Me (chuckling) - “Okay, sure”

The funny thing is that I didn’t have any of the original packaging with me, let alone the accessories. They even gave me a new travel case. I walked out of that store baffled as to what just happened. All I needed was a different light seal but I ended up with a brand new AVP plus a few extra accessories. I don’t know what’s up with my local Apple store but it seems they are extremely strict about adhering to their system. Better yet, maybe he was just being a bro ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Cyberpunk 2077 in VR on Apple Vision Pro,"After spending quite a bit of time configuring ALVR and the Luke Ross VR mod, I've managed to get Cyberpunk 2077 running in full VR on the Apple Vision Pro, and omg does it look absolutely stunning 🤯. It's a bit rough around the edges and needs further tweaking, but it's quite impressive nonetheless. Seeing the city from this perspective completely changes the experience. Hopefully one day it'll be implemented into the game by the devs or an option in Cyberpunk 2. ",246,1bi9v8c,VisionPro,https://youtu.be/VTrR2RO43ME?si=F8Wn9qmCy1PCxETb,99,1710816454.0

(Bloomberg) Apple Vision Pro deliveries are delayed to March,"""*Apple Inc. began taking preorders for its long-awaited Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Friday, and early indications suggest that buyers are snapping up initial supplies of the $3,499 device.*   
  
*The product went on sale at 8 a.m. Eastern time on Apple’s website and mobile app, ahead of its rollout on Feb. 2. Delivery dates for all three models quickly slipped to March 8-15 for online orders, and the device was sold out for in-store pickup on day one at many locations. The delay signals that either demand is strong or supplies are limited — or something in between.*

*Apple shares gained as much as 1.8% to $191.95 Friday in New York, erasing most of its 2% decline for January.*   
  
*With the launch, the company disclosed two additional configurations: a version with 512 gigabytes of storage for $3,699, and a top-end model with 1 terabyte of space for $3,899. The base model includes 256 gigabytes of storage. The company also said it would sell a carrying case for $199 and additional batteries for $199, while extra bands will cost $99 a piece.*   
  
*The purchasing process for the Vision Pro is unique. Customers need to use a recent iPhone or iPad to scan their head and, if necessary, provide a vision prescription. Apple typically doesn’t comment on the sales performance of new products.*  
*Wall Street analysts are predicting a slow start for the device. UBS Group AG analyst David Vogt expects Apple to ship 300,000 to 400,000 units this year, generating as much as $1.4 billion. For a company that had sales of $383 billion last year, that’s “immaterial.”*

*Still, the idea is to set the stage for something bigger. Apple is entering its first major new product category since the company began selling smartwatches in 2015, and the Vision Pro may take years to catch on. Apple will continue to refine the headset — making it cheaper and more comfortable — and find compelling applications for the device.*  
  
*In the longer run, Apple could use a fresh moneymaker. The smartphone market has matured, and it’s under particular pressure in China. The company’s revenue has fallen for four straight quarters — its longest streak of declines in more than two decades.*

*Initially, the Cupertino, California-based company only plans to sell the Vision Pro in the US, with launches in other markets coming in the months ahead. The company is eyeing the UK, Canada and China as some of the first other countries, Bloomberg News has reported.*  
  
*It’s a complex product to manufacture, which could limit early supplies. The dual 4K resolution displays in the headset, which melds virtual and augmented reality, have suffered production snags. But the fact that Apple has been ramping up manufacturing for months suggests that it will be able to satisfy initial demand. The company is also offering a 25% discount on the device for employees, signaling that supplies aren’t too tight.*

*Inside Apple, executives are anticipating a strong opening weekend, with sales tapering off later. At $3,499, the Vision Pro is one of the priciest consumer headsets ever — about seven times more expensive than the latest device from VR market leader Meta Platforms Inc.*  
  
*The Vision Pro also will be a hard product to share with family and friends. It requires a precise fitting process to ensure a good experience. The face scan is designed to determine the best light seal and strap size for users. The company has prepared 25 different light seals — a cushion that prevents light from seeping into the wearer’s field of view — in addition to two straps. There also are prescription lens inserts, at an additional cost.*   
  
*And the headset may be hard for some people to wear for extended periods. In early testing, some users have found it to be too heavy.*  
  
*Another concern that’s cropped up in recent days is a lack of support from top streaming apps. Netflix Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Google’s YouTube are opting not to release software for the device, at least at launch.*  
  
*But Apple has carefully refined its sales pitch for the headset. When consumers try it out at Apple retail stores, they’ll get a 25-minute demo, letting them get comfortable with the 3D experience that the company calls “spatial computing.”*  
  
*To commemorate the launch, Apple executives Mike Rockwell and Alan Dye discussed the device in a Q&A shared with employees this week.*  
  
*A key focus, said Dye, was ensuring that the Vision Pro didn’t have a closed-in feel — a complaint with VR headsets.*  
  
*“From the onset, we all had concerns about people sitting with their eyes covered and disconnected from the world,” he said. “It really became central to how we thought about the core principles of the product.”*  
  
*That led to the EyeSight system, which can show a wearer’s eyes through a screen on the front of the Vision Pro. “It was a huge technical challenge to do this in a way that looks and feels natural,” Rockwell said.*  
  
*Apple also developed an interface that doesn’t require handheld accessories. Instead, it tracks eye movement and hand gestures. Users control the device by looking at an on-screen item and pinching their fingers together to select it.*  
  
*One of the biggest selling points may be how easy it makes collaboration, Rockwell said. Users in far-flung locations can feel like they’re in the same place.*  
  
*“It’s the closest thing to being there in person that you can possibly have,” Rockwell said. “It changes the way you collaborate and is very different from videoconferencing as we know it.”*

I wound up with the below repo.  I am still testing and bug fixing it, but it seems to work (with an ISO, I don't have a BD player anymore).  Testing is obviously slow since it involves a few steps and BD are 45GB.  I am open to suggestions, help, or any other feedback :)

I know it's not the cleanest code, but it was fun.  I created an installer that installs the deps including home-brew and wine, clones/pulls the source to \~, and gets everything setup.
